Although I\u0026rsquo;m not a big fan, I do respect the message that he is sending here: Do something you care about and hustle. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhqZ0RU95d4 While watching this video this primary question came up that I noticed. Reflect on this:\nWhat do you want to do? In my opinion, it is worthwhile to know what you want to do. It may or may not be what you are doing now, but at least you know that. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned that I\u0026rsquo;m the type of person that has to carry about the things I\u0026rsquo;m doing. That\u0026rsquo;s probably why I\u0026rsquo;m a teacher. The reality check is that I get to do what I want to do by working. Sometimes the work I do doesn\u0026rsquo;t match what I want to do. Gary V said that you have to position yourself to be able to build your brand equity. Building an online business is my way of positioning myself to live the way I want. One day I would like to have the choice not to \u0026ldquo;have to\u0026rdquo; go into work. I will be able to teach when I want to, because I want to.\nWho do you care about?

The smart professionals that use these types of products know how it can speed up your workflow and save money. The downside of this product is that some of it is good, some of it is bad. Let’s assume you found a good vendor and want to know if the discount deal, or flash offer, you’re contemplating needs to be worth the investment. Nobody wants to spend a fortune on content that doesn’t produce results, right? In this article we will explore 6 key questions to bring clarity around the White Label you want to buy.\nContents Question 1- What\u0026rsquo;s your core objective?\nQuestion 2 - What\u0026rsquo;s your niche market?\nQuestion 3 - Who is your target audience?\nQuestion 4 - What format does the white label product provide?\nQuestion 5 - What formats will you create?\nQuestion 6 - What\u0026rsquo;s your traffic plan? [Download the Checklist] Wait! Let’s go back a second - White Label? Private Label Rights? What is that? White label content, aka PLR (Private Label Rights), is a license sold by a vendor that gives you the rights to rebrand and use it like your own. Software platforms may offer white label licenses and privileges. White label content is text, audio, graphics, video or some combination of these that are created around a topic. You can buy a license to rebrand, re-organize and publish as if you wrote it yourself. However, buyers don’t always make the most use out of their white label purchases.\nUnused is not useful It hurts to look at your Seagate hard drive filled with content that you have not used. At some point it made sense to purchase the content, but nothing was ever done with it. The whole point of buying this content was to save yourself time and money on creating good content for your audience and potential customers. Why did this happen? In my experience, I’ve noticed one simple thing that causes forgotten use of good white label content: lack of clarity. This doesn’t mean that your business is lacking clarity. What I am talking about is you didn’t have the clarity to decide and take action with the content you purchased. By owning a business, I know that you know how to take action and bring value. There is no question there. You’re a go-getter already. However, your white label content use will have a higher likelihood of success when you are clear about how you want to use it. Go through these six questions to gain more clarity before you purchase. . You can download a free checklist [Download the Checklist] Question 1: What is core objective for this product? Every content product you create should have a purpose, leading toward some objective. Not all blog posts will directly ask for a sale, but each article should have a goal in mind. Take some time to think about what you will create with the product you are buying.\nExample: Purchasing the Morning Mastery Guide PLR product package has several possible uses. Build my list. You can take the mini report and create an opt-in offer for visitors. Build your authority. You can rebrand the written guide into an ebook that you sell or give to your clients, building your brand authority around the topic. Create a workshop. The way this guide is organized, you could break up the chapters and create mini training series out of the contents. Get more ideas in the checklist [Download the Checklist] Narrow your focus to what you WILL make with this product, not what you COULD make. Analysis paralysis can weigh you down. Too much analysis and brainstorming will put your thoughts in the realm of too many possibilities. White label content is the type of product that sends your synapses into overdrive with all the ideas of what you could make with the contents. Avoid going too far with it. First, identify one practical thing you can do with it that will help enhance your business NOW.\nPro tip When I work with clients on building their website or online sales funnel, the first thing I ask them to create is an opt-in offer. You can see examples of this all over the internet.\nExample #1 Lewishowes.com His website offers a free virtual training at the top. Example #2 Neilpatel.com His website offers to help you get more traffic by entering your website first. Example #3 Zapier.com Zapier offers you a free trial of their software. Having an opt-in offer is the start of a beautiful relationship between you and your customer. White label content can help you create an offer faster.\nQuestion #2 What niche market are you serving? I’ve seen purchases about coronavirus prevention, dog walking, mindfulness and many other targets. Browsing through white label libraries is like searching through amazon at various books to read. It is easy to get lost if you’re not sure who you are serving. New to online business? the spirit of possibilities can emerge and give you a lot of “what ifs” about the content you buy. Reflect on your core business and see if you can create products that are within the niche you are already serving. A personal trainer? – health, fitness, self-improvement are all good topic areas. I’m not sure where apocalypse survival planning would be useful for your audience. Digital marketing strategist or consultant? – copywriting, seo and process management contents might help your clients. There are tons of niches to serve out there. Some of the most profitable niches online are:\nMaking money online Health \u0026amp; Fitness Self Improvement Relationships Local Marketing Survival Prep Planning and Journaling And many many more Pro Tip An easy way to know your niche Go to amazon and see if there is category for it. If there, there is a big chance that you have a good niche market. [Download the Checklist] Question #3 Who is your target audience? This might seem similar to choosing a niche, but it has its differences. When I ask who your target audience is, I’m asking you to define the persona of your ideal customer. If you’ve never done this before, it can take some time to develop a persona, you’re in luck! Hubspot has created a persona generator that is free to use. https://www.hubspot.com/make-my-persona Short on time?\nHere is a quick breakdown of some points to consider when thinking about your target audience: Offline or Online. Does your audience tend to connect with you online or offline? A motivational speaker will have an easier time printing out a book to sell at events than telling members to go online and buy. Socio Demographics. These are the income, age, sub-culture facts that best fit your target customer. Challenges. These are also called pain points. What is a problem that your target customer is having that your product or service will solve?\nFor example: a mid-twenties male going through his quarter-life crisis. He has been in the same job for 3 years and doesn’t know how to ask for a promotion or raise. My guide will show he how to be more assertive, and he will learn strategies for negotiating a raise.\nQuestion #4: What format will you get with this white label product? Evaluate the white label offer that you are looking at. Not all of them are created equal. Some of them offer things you can use. Other products might have things you don’t want to use. Let me show you a few examples\nExample #1: Ways to Manage Your Work at Home Content Bundle This Ways to Manage Your Work at Home content bundle contains text-based blog posts. For a blogger that wanted to get more traffic from people looking for a way to work more effectively at home, this package would be a good one to use. components included:\nblog posts text Price: free Example #2 How to Create a Content Marketing Plan Courseware Content Bundle This How to Create a Content Marketing Plan training package contains everything you need to run a workshop or seminar. It comes with 5 pre-made modules on the topic of creating a content marketing plan. For a marketing consultant that wanted to quickly be able to offer a training workshop for clients, this would be a great pack to use. Components included:\nCourse Book Workbook Content Marketing Plan Template Editorial Calendar Excel Template Summary Cheat Sheet Infographic Price: $97 Always check the components that you are getting. Think about what components will fill your needs best. Question 5 will help. Pro tip Not all white label content is created equal. Over time you will have a preferred list of vendors that you like to get content from. Before you spend a lot of money on a new creator, buy something small to check the quality of what they produce.\nQuestion #5 What formats do you plan to create? After you peruse the contents of what the white label content has to offer, it is important to identify what formats you plan to create for your own product. Ebook? You’ll need text. Software? You’ll need the code Infographics? Need some graphics and layouts Training Workshop? You’ll need text content, images, videos, worksheet templates and maybe more. Maybe a mix of the above. Think through what you want to create.\nPro Tip Start small. If you don’t have an opt-in offer yet, start there. You could take a free blog post series and create a mini report that has 2-3 articles in it. You could also convert the blog post contents into podcast outline for yourself to record.\nDecide if the components you are getting match what you want to make.\nAn example of how I’ve used white label content in a company. When I ran a training department, we received a request to create training for managers to be able to communicate expectations with their team members. Not new. We used white label content to speed up our time to delivery on soft skills training programs like these. We could have built from scratch, researching the Harvard business series, looking for the top selling books on manager communication, digging into some of the best practices found in professional associations. This would have taken time and money. Instead, we used a white label courseware package, containing over 45 different soft skill training topics. There was one course on effective communication. The training package was designed to run as a 5-day workshop. Instead of running the entire workshop, we extracted two modules that were focused on manager communication. There was a lesson on communicating expectations as well. BINGO We saved hundreds of man-hours and were able to create a course using the white label courseware we purchased. Cost: ~$1800\nAnother example: A small, one-person business without much capital I know a life coach that produced blog articles, videos and audio files every week for his business. He did not know about the existence of white label content and what it could do for his business. He spent 3-10 hours per week on content development. White label content could possibly cut that content creation process down in half, if done correctly.\nknowing the answers to questions 1,2, and 3 are vitally important to avoid making purchases that you don’t need. In the case of a life coach. There are two ways that white label content helped his business. 1. It helped him create an eBook on a topic that attracted his potential clients. He wanted to focus on creativity. He found a white label ebook that was written about making your own career path. Cost: $47 What would have taken months to research and draft now took about 10 hours to revise and edit for his own style. He added his own personal stories and anecdotes in the beginning. He created action steps at the end of each chapter that would help customers. 2. He used the contents to create a quick reference sheet that he could give away. The contents of his ebook turned out to be a lot. He wanted to offer something smaller as a free opt-in (like I mentioned before. Time saved. SUCCESS\nQuestion #6 What traffic strategy will you use for it? Traffic is always an ongoing topic. Everyone wants more traffic. More important, everyone wants good quality traffic. I won’t have time to get into traffic strategies here. What you should decide is the source. Where do you want your visitors to come from?\nOrganic searching Facebook groups Paid ads Your email list. These are a few things to consider. I hope you found this article useful. I also hope that you will use these questions when you consider purchasing white label content. Remember you can download a free checklist for yourself. Also, if you have any question, do not hesitate to reach out. And remember to download the checklist to take keep this with you.

Before a new team member joins: make sure they receive an employee manual get all the hardware and software they need have a way to connect to you via phone, chat, or email 2 Use video chat whenever possible. It is the closest thing we have to a face to face conversation. 3.1 on 1 Time Schedule a one on one with your new team member to go over work duties, expectations and answer any questions they might have. This will also be a good time to review their schedule and what they should be focused on for the first week. Communication is important for a remote team member to be successful.

This will be the second year in a row that I do this. I wrote a review post in 2018, 2017 and 2014 before that. I felt it was useful for my reflection process and want to continue again. I’m on a 3 year streak now :)\nSomething for you \u0026mdash; 10 Questions to help you review the tapes of 2019 I present to you my 2019 State of Paris (the person; not to be confused with the place). You’ll find the following sections below: What went well?\nWhat didn’t go well?\nWhat did I learn?\nWhat’s ahead for 2020?\nWhat went well? Content Bundles. I participated in my first content bundle. It was run by April Lemarr over at nichestarterpacks.com. I created a special piece of content for the bundle – Fitness Motivation Content Pack. I enjoyed challenging myself to create a content pack like this and getting it ready in time for the bundle launch. I was able to gain new subscribers on my list as well. Got out. One of things I wanted to do this year was get out of the city a few times this year. I was able to get out of Shanghai several times this year, which was great. One trip was not for favorable reasons, but I was able to see family. I also made my way down to Thailand. I really enjoyed the relax time there. China Company. This was a big step forward for doing more business inside China. I went through the process of registering a company in China. The process has gotten easier than it used to be in the past. Hit CC debt zero. I hit zero credit card debt at one point this year. The feeling was amazing. I will be there again this year, and I will be staying there for a while if I can help it.\nWhat didn’t go well? Personal Loss. It was a shock learning that my Grandmother was on her last days this year. Only by God’s grace was I able to fly back home in time to say goodbye, before she took her last breath. While I still mourn her, I also give thanks to God for making a place for her in heaven. Love you Granny! Content Creation. I aimed to create 6 new pieces of white label content along with 12 new pieces of blog articles. Both weren’t achieved this year. I will need to go back to basics and revisit my habits that allowed me to create content before. Routines and Habits. I felt like my habits went out of whack this year. My rhythm was off and I struggled to get it back. Outsourcing. I tried outsourcing some writing assignments, attempting to build a small team of writers. The quality came out “meh.” There was one writer that showed good potential. I will probably attempt to work with her again when I get in a good rhythm with my content creation.\nWhat did I learn? Showing Up is better than not. Although I didn’t achieve many of the things that I had set out to accomplish this year, I did find a way to continually show up for many things. There were times when my mood and energy levels were super low. Rather than curling up in a ball, I mustered up the strength to go forward and just show up. Once I got to a certain point, things were okay. One example is how I handled fitness this year. My morning routine used to be regimented, involving a walk to the gym by 7am at the latest. This year I was not waking up that early anymore. Instead I had to adjust my workout times and schedules on the fly. Even if I wasn’t in the mood to go to the gym, I forced myself to walk over. Just show up. Usually when I arrived, I did something productive. And that is the lesson. Outsourcing will require time/money in the beginning. This is a BIG lesson for running a one-man company with virtual team members. It will take some time and investment to get the right people working with you. Keep strict accounts. Keeping track of expenses and income are essential to analyzing your business growth, or decline. Never catch yourself wondering where it all went.\nWhat’s ahead for 2020? 2020 is a year for clarity I believe. There are several things that I would like to focus on going forward into the year. Small Habits. I believe these will be the building blocks of achievement for this year. I will start with one small habit of reading 20 minutes every day. Then I will slowly get back to waking up earlier in the morning and finishing a six-minute morning routine. Content Creation. I will be carving out time to focus on content creation. This time I want to work on one thing at a time rather than several products at once. I think this will allow me to stay focused on finishing. Stacking this with other habits will compound into something. I can feel it. Savings. An important step this year is to save money. I plan to work toward saving for a move to Europe or southeast asia. Either way it will take some money to make that move out of Shanghai, and I will have to be ready. I plan to keep track of income more accurately than before. I want to know which channels it is coming from, in addition to which channels it is not coming from. This will help me isolate the processes and products that are producing results. Several of my passive income mentors have an ‘income dashboard’ of sorts for tracking what is coming in. I want to do the same. Well, that’s it for now. Let’s see how 2020 shapes up.\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2020/02/2019-state-of-paris/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt’s time to “review the tapes” of the past year.

I present to you my 2018 State of Paris (the person; not to be confused with the place). You’ll find the following sections below:\nContents What went well? What didn’t go well? What did I learn? What’s ahead for 2019?\nWhat went well? Felt the burn. I amazed myself when I dropped my bodyfat down to about 11% by May this year. I really paid attention to my diet during that time. I have to thank Mark over at MuscleHack.com for publishing such a comprehensive guide. It really helped guide me through. White Label Products. One of my aims for 2018 was to create more white label content products and make them available for professionals everywhere. I successfully created a content pack for Morning Mastery. Generated over $1,000 in 7 days and is now in a place to add to my passive income setup. This pack is good for coaches, therapists and trainers that want to offer a morning routine guide to their clients. Family Time. I saved up my paid vacation time and used it to spend a little over 3 weeks back home. It was worth it to spend some time with my family. It was great to have enough time to get over jetlag and still be there with family. Website Business Grows. What started as a freelance side project has continued to grow into a viable business stream. I created several more websites for clients and started offering maintenance packages again. This year I’ve also invested in being an agency partner with Bookmark Website Builder [*affiliate link]. This platform allows me to offer a lower priced website tier. If you’re not quite ready to take on a self-hosted website, there are other options to explore. Relationship. This was a sore spot for me the last few years. This year has had a remarkable turn. When I least expected it, I met someone that I feel like I am able to grow with. She challenges me in many ways. I am learning a lot about myself, and enjoying the process of having a partner in the same city to share life with.\nWhat didn’t go well? Digital Products. I was expecting to get into a rhythm this year and produce more products than I did. When I reflect on why I didn’t get as much out, I find that my energy was diverted in other places. It is hard to say if it was a good thing or a bad thing. Debt. I set a target to pay off my credit card debt this year. That did not happen. In fact, it looks like my balance didn’t go down much. I was paying much more than the monthly minimum. However, I guess I also made more purchases than I should have using the card. Blogging. I wanted to publish one good post per month. Just like the digital products, my energy and time were diverted elsewhere. Morning Routine. My morning routine was disrupted this year. I expanded my six minute morning into a morning workout and walk. This increased the routine to more than 60 minutes. This was difficult to maintain. I think I will go back to a shorter kickstart routine for myself in order to maintain consistency. My workout times can be more flexible. I want to make sure I start my day out right. Reading. I felt like I did not read as many books for myself this year. I did a lot of reading for classes and workshops. I want to get back to reading one book at a time and doing a little bit each day until that book is gone. The first book I want to get through is Paul Jarvis’ new book, Company of One [*affiliate link]. Focus. I feel like I was focused on doing things this year. Where I fell short was not focusing on that top 20% of things that I would have brought 80% of the results. This is something that I will have to work on gradually going forward.\nWhat did I learn? Progress over perfection. There were many times where I got stuck because I wanted to do things “right.” The funny thing is that right is a relative term in itself. I find that making progress is more important than knowing all the info and getting it all finished at once. There are a few select times when an attention to perfection. Relationships require work. This goes for both intimate and family relationships. While living abroad is a challenge in itself, staying in touch and meeting the needs of those you love takes some focused work. In the past I took this for granted. I realized this year, with the help of my partner, that it is worth putting the time and energy into this. I can squat without knee pain. I previously believed that squats would cause my knee to flare up and add more pain. I studied and learned more about maintaining proper form. This has helped a lot. I am now able to squat without any pain or swelling afterwards. Online business development is like a snowball. Think of your customers as snowballs. If I create new products for different groups of people, I will have a lot of small snowballs. An alternative way to build is targeting one group of people and developing multiple products for that audience. This leads to a growing number of customers. Thus, creating a larger group of potential buyers that want what you make. I need a virtual assistant. This has been an area of weakness for myself. I am fine with outsourcing work on a short project. I feel that now I might need some support a few hours per week to help me get administrative tasks done.\nWhat’s ahead for 2019? Passive Income Streams. I aim to create more passive income streams for myself. My target is to have a monthly cashflow that is equivalent to my day job. I believe this is possible with the right focus. White Label Products. I see that there is a need for these products and love meeting and working with the people doing this. I will continue to create great content for other businesses and professionals to use. I want to focus on three niches: self improvement, internet marketing, and fitness. Better Support Process. As customer numbers increase, I also want to get better at how I provide support for my products and services. I have a few things in the works and will be making some decisions soon about the what and how. Blogging. I am going to put it out there again. 12 good blog posts. One per month released for my audience. I got the first one done already. It connects Chinese Xiaolong Gao with New Year’s Resolutions. This idea grew from seeing how people liked the post about What’s Your Stinky Tofu? All in all, I think the word for the year is progress. Last year it was grow slow. I am really looking forward to what comes this year.

I felt it was useful for my reflection process and want to continue again. I present to you my 2018 State of Paris (the person; not to be confused with the place). You’ll find the following sections below:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"2018 State of Paris"},{"content":"The Fresh Start Effect is in full steam. More than a dozen people have asked me what my resolutions for 2019 are. It’s only natural that I would reflect on the idea of resolutions. A better thought is how to make resolutions actually stick and become a reality. The web is full of tips and techniques for making resolutions stick. I’ve included some links to these at the end of the post. What I offer today is a slightly different approach to resolutions - some would even call it savory : )\nApproach your New Year’s resolutions like eating Xiaolongbao. Wait? Xiaolongwhat? For those who have not experienced this delicious Shanghai cuisine, let me explain a little bit.\nWhat is Xiaolongbao? Xiaolongbao 小笼包, pronounced like SHAOW LOW-NG BAOW, is a special type of dumpling. It’s different than other types of dumplings because it has soup-like sauce inside. The fillings can have veggies and meats.\nWhat does Xiaolongbao have to do with New Year’s Resolutions? On the surface, nothing. Xiaolongbao is a food. New Year’s Resolutions are a promise you make to yourself for change. If we look at the process of HOW we eat this wonderful, bite-sized food, there is wisdom that can be applied pursuit of maintaining resolve.\nXiaolongbao rule #1 Pick it up carefully. Being adept with chopsticks is not enough. Xiaolongbao has an incredibly thin skin on the bottom. If you squeeze to hard or move to quickly, this dumpling will collapse before you get if off the tray. Use care when picking up your dumpling. For Resolutions - Resist the desire to grab everything at once. Trying to have it all at the same time could lead to indecision or poor handling. It is better to focus on one thing at a time and spend some focused time giving it our energy and time.\nXiaolongbao rule #2 Don’t try to eat it all at once. A common mistake with xiaolongbao is trying to eat the whole thing at one time. The soup inside the dumpling will burn your mouth if you try to jam the whole thing in your mouth and chew. Instead, I was taught a technique of taking a small bit of the outer layer first. This gives the soup a chance to cool down before you eat it. For Resolutions - Identify a small part of your resolution to take on first. You may have to deal with the feeling of wanting to get it all done now. Resist. Small wins over time add up to bigger wins.\nXiaolongbao rule #3 Take your time to enjoy each part. After taking a small bite out of the dumpling, you can allow the sauce to drip into a spoon. Another technique is to suck out the soup sauce through the opening you made. It is less likely to burn you. For Resolutions - Find a way to enjoy your progress consistently. And don’t forget to celebrate your success along the way.\nLet’s take a real life example using these three rules. Rule #1 Pick it up carefully. In the context of new years resolutions, Johnny has made a handful of resolutions for different areas of his life.\nPay off Credit Card Debt Start a Side Business Travel to 10 countries Wake Up earlier Spend more time with family Choosing to take on everything at once could be disastrous. Instead he decides to start with one that could impact all the others. He chooses to work on waking up earlier. Why does he want this? Waking up earlier will give him more time in the morning to get things done. It will also allow him more time to create a morning routine that sets the right tone for the day. Alright. Let’s move on to the next rule. Rule #2 Don’t try to eat it all at once. Take a small bit first. Johnny’s goals is to wake up at 5:30am every morning. Right now he kinda wakes up at 6:45am, rolls over, checks his instagram for 10 minutes, goes back to sleep for 20 more minutes, and finally gets out of bed. He could set his alarm for 5:30am and try to wake up earlier. There is some benefit to tackling something head on. However, Johnny remembers the rules and decides to start small. His first goal is goal is to get out of bed as soon as it hits the alarm. To help with this, he moves the alarm clock across the room. This forces him to him to get out of bed to turn it off. Boo-ya!\nRule #3 Take your time to enjoy each part. Now Johnny wants to find a way to enjoy making progress when he wakes up immediately. He decides to do something he enjoys with the extra time he has in the morning, like writing. He creates a plan to make his alarm 10 minutes earlier each week until he hits the 5:30am target. Johnny is looking good. I hope this analogy and example helps give new insights into sticking with your new year resolutions. It can be overwhelming when you first start, but so rewarding when you follow-through. As a closing note I’ve added a little video by Jim Rohn explaining the meaning of resolve.

But as he was sleeping, an angel touched him and told him, “Get up and eat!” ~1 Kings 19:5 NLT This passage was used in a sermon I heard this week (kudos to brother Larry Paige). The purpose of the message was to raise awareness of the physical and mental influences of anxiety and depression. I believe that God did not intend for us to be in depression, anxiety and self-doubt. Yet there are times in our life when these feelings and circumstances surround our entire being. In these moments our perspective is skewed. Everything we see and hear converts into a message lack. “I don’t have enough.” “I’m not ready.” “I just want to feel this way.” When I read the passage in 1 Kings, it brings some insight into how we can begin to deal with these negative feelings.\nGet touched Before we get into what the angel told Elijiah, it’s important to note that an angel came down and touched him. Our angels might not come in the form of white-robed creatures with wings. Perhaps this is a friend, a neighbor or even someone else in need. Someone or something is going to trigger and call you to make a move. The difference between moving and not moving will be in having our eyes and ears ready to receive.\nGet Up This part reminds me of when Tony Robbins talks about his morning routine. He begins with a radical change in his physiology. I’m not saying everyone should go jump in a cold shower or an ice bath. However, I something radically different than the position you were in before is required. If you are lying down, jump up. If you are walking, sprint! Movement is one way to reduce cortisol and increase dopamine (the pleasure hormone) in your system. If we can get ourselves moving, this is already a huge step.\nGet the right food There have been numerous times where I get so absorbed in a project and forget to eat. The lack of food quickly turns into a energy drop and in an increase in hangriness. My mood shifts and creativity wanes down. The default feeling I have is to take a nap. This might help a little, but I probably really needed to eat something. Eating something doesn’t mean to eat anything. A fried chicken wing is going to have a different effect on your body than a piece of grilled salmon.\nGet Moving After you start to change your physical state and get some fuel in your body, it’s time to move. You can reduce those cortisol levels by increasing the amount of good stress and action. This is one reason why I like weight training and cardio. It helps set my body in a positive vibration. The key word for moving is momentum. When you are in motion, make sure you keep fueling and driving forward to stay in motion. In this particular passage of 1 Kings we can see that Elijiah made some moves. He got up. He ate some bread. Then he had enough energy to hike a mountain and share his message. Get Up. Eat. Run.

It has been a useful tool for tracking the food that I eat each day. I still wish there were calculations for the Chinese food dishes I love. I guess I can\u0026rsquo;t have everything. Man I miss that Gong Bao Ji Ding 宫保鸡丁. Mmmmmm. I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered that there is one big problem with many of the food tracking apps. It\u0026rsquo;s not a bug. It\u0026rsquo;s not a user interface glitch. It\u0026rsquo;s not even because they don\u0026rsquo;t have my local restaurant\u0026rsquo;s Gong Bao Ji Ding listed in the database. I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you what the biggest problem is.\nIt focuses too much on weight As soon as you register for the app it gives you the option to set a weight goal. I\u0026rsquo;m sure this is what most consumers want, but is it what they really need? I think I need to explain. I recently went on a cycle of low carb, high fat eating while incorporating strength training. I would have one high carb day per week. I kept my daily calories below the maintenance amount. My goal was to cut down a few pounds of fat. Look at what happenened My weight actually went up over a few weeks. I gained almost 2KG! Does it look like it. From my point of view I was achieving my goal of cutting down some fat. However, I think I gained some muscle at the same time. This actually made my weight fluctuate upward rather than downward. And yes, I even took off my pants in the second photo to make sure the weight was right.\nWeight is Not a Reliable Measure Your weight can fluctuate from day to day. There are so many factors that impact it. Yet on most of food apps they continuously ask you to check in in with your weight. I think this might encourage the wrong behaviors. I know some that try to skip meals. I know others who try to eat too few calories that their metabolism crashes. Watching your weight too closely can do more harm than good.\nInstead of Weight, Try These I\u0026rsquo;d like to give you a few alternatives to measuring weight while you are achieving your fitness and health goals. Track your energy levels. If you feel like you have more energy and strength throughout the day, you\u0026rsquo;re probably doing something good. Measure parts of your body. Grab a tape measure and keep track of your arms, thighs, hips, waist and chest circumference. If your goal is to reduce the size, they\u0026rsquo;ll go down. If you want to increase, they\u0026rsquo;ll go up. Personal Challenges. Find something that you can measure in your activity. Take push ups for example. If you want to get stronger, see if you can do things that will increase your push up count. Fat Calipers. When people usually tell me they want to lose weight, what they really mean is they want to lose fat. Use some fat calipers and take measurements weekly. This will probably be more reliable than a scale. Those are a few ideas to help get you going. I\u0026rsquo;m sure there are some that I missed. You can get creative.\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2018/05/the-biggest-problem-with-food-tracking-apps/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been logging in to MyFitnessPal for more than 80 days in a row.

I wanted to use the same principles talked about in the Six Minute Morning to create a routine and habit for myself to get fit. I’d like to share with you my results and what I’ve learned so far.\nSlow and Consistent Progress I weighed 94.8kg (208.9 pounds) and my roommate told me that I was getting chunky. On April 30, 2018 I weighed in at 83.9kg (184.9 pounds) You may notice I didn’t lose it all in 90 days. This was slow, consistent progress. There was even a spike in the wrong direction along the way. I feel like I’ve made a change for the better. I stayed consistent with using my gym membership.\nHow I got started – April, 2017 My roommate told me I was getting chunky. We were sitting around, watching tv and he suggested we check out getting a gym membership at the Hilton. The best part was that it had a hotub, resting room and decent pool. It was worth a shot. Long story short, I bought a membership. Now I had to get myself to use it. With any habit or routine, ease and convenience are important. I chose a gym that was close enough that I could walk. I also made sure it opened early enough for me to get there in the morning so I could make it part of my morning routine. My first target was to walk up to the gym every day. I didn’t even have to workout. Just going there was enough. Easy to do without pressure to perform. From there everything else unfolded. July-August 2017 My primary goal was to be stronger in heart and stronger in body. I had been consistently going to the gym 5-6 days per week. The elliptical cross trainer and bicycle became my two new friends. We saw each other almost everyday. I could feel myself getting less tired as each week went past. I could push a little bit harder or a little bit harder. Good feeling. November-December 2017 My heart was in a good place. I was able to move on the exercise machines for 90 minutes and I could vary the intensity. A couple times a week I would do 10-20 minute HIIT sessions to keep myself pushing. I finished each cardio session with some pushups and pullups. My pullup strength increased from doing none to doing 5. We changed over to the Kerry Gym in Jing An. Better equipment at a comparable price. Side note: In my mind I felt like I was one step away from being shredded. lol! I had a lot to learn.\nJanuary 2018 I start playing around with my diet and meal plan. This is what inspired the post, are you tracking whats going in[link]. My routine was pretty solid. Although the new gym was 10 minutes farther away, I was still getting up there in the mornings. February 2018 I started a more structured weight training program. 5 days per week. I wanted to focus on a couple body parts each day.\nShoulders \u0026amp; Traps Legs \u0026amp; Abs Biceps \u0026amp; Triceps Back Chest and Abs These workouts took less than 45 minutes to complete. March 2018 – April 2018 I wasn’t 100% strict on my carb cycling diet. This did effect some of my results. I ate clean most of the time and eliminated many extra snacks while working out. My strength increased each week while on this program. Going Forward I enjoy my time at the gym. I enjoy learning about healthy food options. I want to keep increasing muscle and losing fat if I can. In the words of my brother, Habi, eat clean and train dirty. Let’s see where this takes me.

Last year as I was dropping 10kg, I focused more on the “When” things went in for the year. I also gestimated “a little bit less” for each meal. At the start of this year I wanted to be more intentional about what goes into my body.\nWhy is it important to track what goes into the body? There are a few reasons why being aware of what goes in the body is important.\nAbs are made in the kitchen not the gym. There is a phrase along those lines floating around. I think it is true. _Correction:_I was told this statement might be misleading. Abs are built in the gym. They are a muscle like anything else. However, they will reveal themselves based on what you do in the kitchen.\nGetting the right nutrients into your body is important for maintaining your energy throughout the day. If you don’t have the right nutrients, your productivity will suffer. It helps you become aware of how certain foods impact your performance. Like eating that Turkey sandwich before you write a blog post = snoozeville. There are probably more reasons, but those are what I can think of at the moment. What have I learned so far about tracking meals? I was recently introduced to the term, macronutrients. What are macronutrients? Macronutrients are the three big categories of substance that make up food. They are Proteins, Carbs and Fat. Those three words are used all the time in grocery stores. “High in Protein” “Low Fat” “Low Carb” I’m sure you’ve seen some of these things as well. Basically, it is a good place to start to become more aware of what goes in your body. You’ll be able to answer questions like: Am I getting enough protein to maintain my current muscle mass? Am I eating too many carbs? Should I eat everything that is low fat? Fat can be good for you. One thing that surprised me is how good fat can be for the body. When I was growing up, there was a huge emphasis on low fat foods. Everything had it on the label. However, my reading has taught me that there are good fats and bad fats. Many of the good fats are important for keeping your body healthy. Like eggs. Eggs has a lot of fat in the yolk, but that yolk is full of good stuff for the body. A lot of the good fats help coat the organs and keep your system flowing. Some forms of fats will help clear bad cholestorol out of your arteries. Not all carbs are equal Atkins and Ketogenic diets propose a low or no carb meal plan. This is great for increasing your protein intake. It’s also good for losing water weight. I would be reluctant to tell someone not to take in any carbs at all. Why? Well, many greens contain the nutrients that we can’t find in other non-carb foods. So rather than taking a no-carb approach, it’s probably best to stick with a low carb plan. I’ve learned a few tips that might help:\nEat vegetables that grow above ground. Anything that grows below ground are much higher in carb and calories. Avoid anything white or that could be white. I learned this tip whil reading Tim Ferriss’ book, “Four Hour Body.” That would include white potatoes, radishes, rice, bread, etc. Although, I have made one exception. Cauliflower. Some carbs are usable while other are not useable. Usable carbs will go from the stomach into the body and be used for energy, or fat if they aren’t used. Unusable carbs are like fiber. They go through our digestive track and keep the poo-poo coming out smooth. Don’t’ for get to have enough fiber when your planning your meals. You’re probably not eating enough protein. I learned how to calculate the amount of protein I should be eating to maintain muscle mass. 2.75 x Lean Body Mass in KG When I did the calculation, I learned that I need to injest about 184 grams of protein per day. Geez! I wasn’t getting enough. That’s like eating 7 chicken breasts each day to meet the requirement. Of course, some other foods also have protein as well. I personally like spinach, nuts and beans. Changing your attitune about food First step is always to be aware. Be aware of where you are now. How much are you eating? If you don’t know, start keeping a food diary for one week. Track the foods and snacks that go into your body. You don’t necessarily have to begin tracking grams, calories and macros. Getting started with tracking is a good first step. I started by creating a notebook in evernote and called it my food diary. I just wrote down the food that I ate throughout the day for five days. At the end of the week I went back to see how much I was eating.\nAre there any apps that can help me track my food? There are a number of apps out there that can help you with being more aware of your food intake. I spent the last 2 weeks testing out four apps to see which one I like using best. Argus, Lifesum, MyPlate and MyFitnessPal, Macrotrack\nMacrotrack http://www.macrotrakapp.com/ The simplest app I have tried. It focuses only on calories and macros. There are no extras. Who is it good for? Good for the person who knows how to do their own calculations and wants to keep things super simple. If you eat the same foods on most days, this app can be very useful. Any downsides? The downside is that you have to build your own database for this app. You will have to manually add the foods and macronutrients for each one. This can get a bit annoying when you change your meals or don’t know the numbers for a food.\nArgus http://www.azumio.com/s/argus/index.html Argus has a fun scrolling layout. It does more than track foods. This app will give you a visual display of calories burned, daily steps, heart rate and meals. The meal tracker is connected to a database with tons of food listed. You’ll be able to find what your eating or something close enough to estimate your meals quickly. It also has a label scanner to add your grocery store foods easily. Who is it good for? Argus is good for the person that wants to track many things at once and likes having some guidance. The app provides meal plan and recipe recommendations based on what you are trying to achieve. This can take a lot of the guesswork out of deciding on your meals and what to cook. Any downsides? Having so many extras added to the app made the experience a little too busy for me. It took a few steps to get into the meal tracker. I didn’t like that.\nLifesum https://lifesum.com/ This app has a funny, apple-looking character on your diary dashboard. This is a reminder to enter your daily weight. The interface is clean at the top and breaks down how many calories and macros you have left to consume each day. This app also includes a food database and bar code scanner. Who is it good for? Good for the person that likes cartoonish, graphical interface. It feels friendly. The premium upgrade offers more content and tracking features. Any downsides? The free version doesn’t let you set any goals for your macronutrients. It lets you set a target body weight and select a basic meal plan. If I continued using the app, I would definitely have to upgrade to premium.\nMyPlate https://www.livestrong.com/myplate/ MyPlate is from the Livestrong.com group. The quality is there. The interface is simple and shows how many calories are left to eat each day. It has quick buttons at the top of the screen to enter in what you are tracking. Progress charts for almost everything you would want to see. It has workout videos and meal plans that you can follow. The community seems to be very active. The app lets you set daily nutrition goals for your calories and macro percents. Who is it good for? Those who want community and support will like this app. I see lots of updates from other people. That can be motivating. Any downsides? I would like to be able to enter in my specific macronutrient goals. Rather than percent only, I would like to be able to enter in the specific grams.\nMyFitnessPal https://www.myfitnesspal.com/ This app was recommended to me by a few people. It is made and managed by Under Armor. The interface is simple and clean. It is focused on food intake and a small section for exercise tracking. You can search a database for food or use the barcode scanner. The app lets you grab recipes from the internet or add your own. You can combine foods into meals for easy entry later on. Who is it good for? This app is good for the person that only wants to track their food intake without too many extra add-ons. There are no meal plans or challenges built in. You enter your food, read a few articles from the blog, maybe add some exercise. That’s it. Any downsides? You have to upgrade to premium if you want to enter specific gram goals for your foods. The interface is not as fun as the other apps I’ve described.\nMy take Overall, I like the MyfitnessPal app the best right now. I’m still deciding between MyPlate and MyfitnessPal. I like the food tracking on both apps. I especially like that MyfitnessPal lets me enter specific amounts for my macros. I might buy the premium on both apps to test them out.

Thoughts of taming lions and running a race were rampant throughout her story. I enjoyed the read and I think you might too. The book is somewhere in between a memior, how-to guide and a lecture series. It’s not easy to describe what it is, but I could share what I liked about it and some of my takeaways. I offer that to you below.\nWhat I liked most about the book I loved Erin’s use of details and willingness to be vulnerable in her writing. She captured moments with such detail, you could imagine yourself right there with her. She shared her thoughts and feelings so openly. Reading the book made me feel like I was sitting across from a friend telling me her story.\nMy takeaways from the book We need to be aware of the lion inside each of us. “There is a lion inside us all. It reigns over pace and time and intention, and it lingers in the rooms of our hearts daily. It roams, searching for the reasons we were placed on this planet— our passions, dreams, abilities— and it scoffs at the demands of our daily lives— our schedules, responsibilities.” The lion inside is not going away. It is a part of us. I can try to run away from it. I can try to tame it. But ultimately, this lion is not for us to control or escape. What we need to do is understand it, become aware of it. “I must be all of my multifaceted self. You must be all of your multifaceted self. We must allow every part of us; we must learn in great form, in human messiness. And we must accept it all. The good and the bad, the philanthropist and the philanderer, the street preacher and the drunk, the mother and the child, both dancing in the kitchen and singing on the sidelines.” There are things about myself that I wish were better. Some might call them weaknesses per se. And they are part of who I am. There is a necessity for each part. I can’t wish away the parts of me I don’t like. They are part of the sum of me. What I can do is learn from them, accept them, be aware of me. Through awareness, not denial, I am free to choose my point of focus.\nPursuits without grace are endless quests for perfection. I’ve seen both seen people take joy in the pursuit of more. I’ve also seen the art of minimalism gain popularity over the last decade. Although the pursuits are slightly different, they both see to stake a claim “I have achieved (more/less).” “I have chased more and I have chased less. I have lived large and I have lived small. I have sped up, slowed down, traded up, pared down, built myself up, fallen down. But have I looked up? Laid it down? Perhaps we were never meant to change the pace. We were meant to surrender it.“ With grace, I can lower the noise around me and get clear. I believe this is what we all want. The race is not about getting ahead or falling behind. It is about living up to the expectations were meant to. I once heard Jim Rohn say, “life is not about what you get, it’s about what you become.” Wise words.\nI don’t need to measure or control everything I was taught to set SMART goals and make metrics for things I want to achieve. I am learning that I don’t need to do this for everything. These tools are useful in the right context. However, when the accumulation or reduction becomes too restricted, I need to stop and ask if this is important at this time. . The race of life is not for us to win or lose. “Many who are last will be first, and the last will be first.” ~Matthew 19:30 It really resonated with me when Erin reminded herself, “…keep slowing down, you’ve got a race to lose.” There are times when I feel like I don’t have enough time to do all the things that I want. When I am sitting there thinking about all these things, I am doing nothing. It is possible to be in the race, to enjoy it and not have to be the first. If I happen to be first, that’s okay. If I’m not first, that’s okay too. I must admit that I read this book slowly. It took me over a year to finish. Other things distracted me in between. Nevertheless, I’m glad that I was able to finish the book.

I offer that to you below.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Chasing Slow - A Reflection"},{"content":"It’s time to “review the tapes” of the past year. The last time I did a year review post was in 2014 I believe. Let’s see how this year goes. Maybe this time it will become a regular thing. I present to you my 2017 State of Paris (the person; not to be confused with the place). You’ll find the following sections below: Contents What went well? What didn’t go well? What did I learn? What’s ahead for 2018?\nWhat went well in 2017 Digital Products. This year I stretched beyond my digital product silo. Rather than only publishing on my own Wordpress sites or teachable, I moved a few courses to Udemy and Skillshare. I did this because Udemy and Skillshare have an audience that can search and find the courses that I publish. This year I tried putting my LinkedIN Summary course on Udemy and Skillshare. Both had some interesting results. Udemy had over 1,000 students enroll when I offered the course for free. Skillshare has over 500 people enrolled. That more than 1500 people that I probably would not have reached without paid advertising. So far, skillshare is showing returns in terms of passive income each month. Additionally, I made a jump into the white label content market. This is also known as PLR (private label rights) content. I created a new brand under AmazingPLR.com for publishing content related PLR products. The first product launch generated over $500 USD within 7 days. Fitness. My roommate, Rob, helped kick this into gear. Both of us had been talking about getting back in shape. The excuses lasted longer than in takes to pour out a bottle of cold molasses. But this year, something changed. We made the investment in a gym membership. I’ve tracked and completed 140 workouts between April and December. This is about 15 workouts per month. The results are starting to show. I went from 94.7kg down to 85.7kg. My resting heart rate has gone down from 76-80 to 50-60. Work. This year I made a big decision to re-enter the working world, meaning I would work under another company rather than continue to be independent. I think this was an important decision to make considering I needed to rebuild my savings after a few costly mistakes were made in 2016. I chose to work on my own terms. I wanted to make sure I was doing something I loved, so I chose to go into teaching. I love it. Of course, the salary is not as high as being in the Fortune 500 corporate role. However, I feel great, have less stress, more time to pursue things other than work. It was a smart choice. Passive Income. This year I am fortunate enough to say that I made some stable passive income. This is income that doesn’t require me to serve for a specified amount of time and comes in even if I do nothing. There have been three primary sources of income this year: Amazon (affiliates program) Skillshare ( online course platform) SimpleWP.co (website maintenance product) Jvzoo (PLR Product) Savings. I challenged myself to live on at most 70% of the money that I brought in. I was able to do this, even with a low salary. I heard this number while listening to a Jim Rohn audio series. I heard it many times, but had never put it into practice. This year I believe I did a good job putting this into practice.\nWhat didn’t go so well? Relationships. I didn’t call and check-in on my family enough this year. Living abroad does have some downsides. I don’t get to see my Mom, Dad, Sister and Brother for most holidays. I intended to call more, but somehow that didn’t happen as often as I would like. I chose to end a romantic relationship this year. I’ve had mixed feelings about this, but overall feel it was the best decision to make for both of us. Blogging. I didn’t do much blogging this year. I wanted to post once per week, but that didn’t happen. I filled my time with other things and found ways to procrastinate. I did a lot of “thinking” and “planning” for the blog rather than actual writing and publishing. This is something I’d like to shift for 2018 and get out some quality posts. Website Building. I offered a Website in a Weekend product to potential customers. The concept didn’t sell as well as I had expected. I think the price point didn’t fit with my target market. For next year, I will be going back to the simple, 3-step model that worked well. Focus. I found myself running into many mental blocks this year. I would focus for about a week. After that, there would be about two weeks of “feeling” like I was unable to generate enough ideas. This may have been due to the shift back to full time working hours again. Revising my routine around creation time will be essential next year. Travel. I didn’t travel outside of Shanghai at all this year. I big reason was that I wanted to focus on chipping away at credit card debt and increase my savings. Nevertheless, I think this might be the first time in 10 years I have gone a full year with out traveling internationally. Well, I do live abroad anyway. Does that count?\nWhat I learned this year? Broke to Banking. It is possible to live on margin even when you’re not on a high income. It does mean strategically saying no to some things. Another way to think about it is that you are saying yes to financial responsibility. Low Impact Workouts Work. As a kid my sports workouts were filled with high impact exercises. I never really learned how to do an intense workout that was also low impact. Due to knee and shoulder injuries, I had to find a solution that would also me to lose fat, build muscle and increase my cardio capacity. I learned that this is possible. Can’t build business in a silo. My most successful digital product came when I tapped the affiliate sales market. Getting other people on board to help promote and sell your product is critical. This is especially true if you don’t have a large customer database to promote to. This lesson goes for all of business. Connecting with people and having others help you along the way is important. Even solo business owners have partners and vendors that help get things done. I really enjoy teaching. My passion for teaching has gone on fire this year. I enjoy spending time with students and watching them grow.\nWhat’s ahead for 2018? Grow Slow I’m borrowing from Erin Loechner’s “Chasing Slow” and going to say it’s time to grow slow. When I focus on doing one thing at a time, I tend to get more done with better results. My focus for 2018 is getting back to the view of focusing on one thing at a time. Like getting this post done was one thing I want to get done before moving to other content creation projects. Growth can happen physically, mentally, spiritually and in business. Why rush it?\nWhat’s to come? 1. This Blog. I would like to write one quality blog post per month. I’m not doing it for the traffic or promotion. I want to share some quality stuff that challenges your thinking and provides resources that equip you to take action. 2. White Label Content. I have a new content pack on the topic of Morning Mastery. My plan is to finish one small step each day until it is launched. If you’re interested in grabbing some white label content and learning more about it, check out amazingplr.com 3. Teaching. I\u0026rsquo;m currently teaching literacy skills to children. There are many topics that I am filtering through and prioritizing for 2018. I\u0026rsquo;ll share more about this when I\u0026rsquo;m clear.\nThe bottom line All in all, many things shifted for me this past year. I’ve seen friends go through many changes as well. I’m not a big fan of setting resolutions. Most of these are forgotten by spring festival. What do have is a list of things that I’d like to pursue and a focus on one thing at a time. I am excited about where I am now and look forward to seeing how things unfold over the next year. I hope you are too. God Bless, Paris\nFor all who are led by the Spirit of God are children of God.

Yes, even if you think you don’t - you still do. This is not the sixth sense type of voice coming from a ghost. I’m talking about the inner chatter that goes one when it is time to perform. There has been a lot of chatter on the web, in coaching circles and meditation zones that give us strategies for quieting down the inner voices.\nWhat if we actually need the opposite? Rather than having less voices in our head, we actually could use some good ones. I was reading an article recently published by Eric Barker that presents evidence suggesting just that. There are three voices we should all add in our head.\n1. The Cheerleader for improved resilience Studies have shown that using “You” yields better results than “I.” So when you get ready to perform, say “You can do this!” instead of “Yes I can.” It will give better results.\n2.

Amazon has a program called Amazon Associates. This program allows anyone to link to Amazon products. When a visitor clicks this link and buys something on Amazon, you get a commission. How much is the commission? Around 3%. This is not a lot when you compare it to other affiliate programs. Why would I use Amazon for such a low commission? Amazon is a major marketplace that people already trust. Most people I know have an Amazon account and feel confident when purchasing from the site. The idea of making a 3% commission on Donald Trump toilet paper doesn’t seem appealing on the surface. However, if there is enough traffic coming to a site with the intention to buy, this can generate a lot of clicks. Additionally, the commission connection is not limited to one specific product. Once a visitor clicks through you are eligible for commissions on any other products they add to that purchase. That is where things get interesting. Wordpress Connection I’ve seen a number of plugins developed to help make the amazon affiliate workflow even easier. Some those include\nEasyAzon Pro [Premium]- helps create amazon affiliate links for you. Amazon Affiliate Link Globalizer - another linking plugin that will send your visitor to their appropriate store when they click. Woo commerce Ad-ons - too many to mention. Basically add an amazon product to your store and send people to purchase on amazon.

There are so many options to choose from. As soon as I feel like I’ve found the right theme for me, I give it a try. I take on the project of rebuilding my website with the new theme. I’ve gone through:\nSalient Theme Make Theme Genesis Framework Enfold Theme Genesis is still my favorite So far, My favorite theme to work with is Genesis Framework. When I need to have a clean, simple site from the beginning, Genesis is great for that. It’s also pretty easy to customize once you get use to the visual hook system available. There are references for that. [https://genesistutorials.com/visual-hook-guide/] I also like the people behind Genesis. Brian Gardner is a virtual mentor for me.\nThe warnings about switching to Divi I’ve read Chris Lema’s warning for those who switch to Divi theme. He warns that it better be forever because the page builder will eat up all your text or leave you with a bunch of jumbled code if you ever decide to leave. You’re in the divi ecosystem for life when you switch. What it really means is that it will be a pain in the but to switch.\nSo… why am I switching to Divi I’ve been watching Divi over the past few years and am impressed with what they are doing with their themes.\nThey are narrowing down Rather than having 1000 themes to pick from, they are focusing in on two themes and making them flexible and functional: Divi and Extra\nNo renewal fees annually Divi has the option of buying a lifetime license. When I worked with Make theme I needed to budget in my annual premium plugin cost each time. The problem with that is that my client builds are mostly a one time project. I will be continuously renewing a subscription in order to keep them up to date. I don’t want to do this from a business perspective. *Note: Genesis does offer a lifetime license option.\nVisual Builder Divi moved from a block based builder ( like make theme builder) to a visual builder. This is perfect for clients that want to make quick changes and see what is happening. I noticed that some clients had trouble visualizing their sites when it was only blocked out. This features adds a “wow” for the clients I serve.\nClient Control I can lock up parts of the the website so clients can mess things up while they are making edits and changes. There is always a “curious” one who wants to try and changes some code or css on their own. Next thing you know they have an internal server error.\nSplit Testing This is one of the primary reasons why I am giving Divi a try. I tend to overanalyze my content writing. I could spend 16 hours working on a headline. With split testing I’ll be able to make several different versions and test them all. The data will tell me what works rather than my own inner dialogue. Awesome. This is also a great selling point for business clients. Not only can they make their landing pages, but they can test out different variations of content.\nPotential to Create Niche Pages and Child Site Packs This is a new potential revenue stream for new clients. I can offer a specific site type with pre-loaded content and page layouts all in one. This is much better than demo content. It also plays in nice with my website content writing course. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to teach a few workshops on Wordpress website building and content writing this summer.

The one roadblock that is keeping you from getting your website going is\nFEAR OF PRESSING THE BUTTON. It’s so simple, but so real. I’ve been there myself. I remember trying to write my very first blog post and not being able to hit the publish button. I combed through the article dozens of times and still couldn’t bring myself to do it. I’m going to share a secret with you… It’s not 100% your fault. That’s right. It’s not your fault, entirely. Here’s why: Many of the fears we have are invisible. Ramit Sethi calls them invisible scripts. Life Coaches call them gremlins. They are the voices in our head that silently convince us we are not ready to put our message out there. We can’t control the voices in our head. What we can do is become more aware of them and make a conscious decision about whether to follow them.\nFEEL THE FEAR AND DO IT ANYWAY Whew! My heart pounds a little faster each time I am about to publish a post, even this one. Over time I’ve gotten used to the voices of fear and doubt in my head trying to creep in. I’ve gotten used to taking a breath, pushing the button and hoping things go alright. I could write a whole post about what could potentially happen wrong :) However, that’s not what we are here to do.\nHOW ABOUT A MIDDLE GROUND? Maybe you’re not convinced that you can publish and see what happens. There is still hope. Here’s what I want you to do: 1. Take out a piece of paper. 2. Write down the names of three close friends. 3. Hit CMD-S on your keyboard to select your post 4. Paste this post into an email message and send to one friend. Don’t worry. You’re not publishing. 5. Ask your friend for feedback about how it reads and if it gets the message across. If they say it’s good, push the publish button. If they have some suggestions, make a few edits and send to the next friend on the list. Give it a try and you will slowly get used to pushing the button on your content. Get it out there and possibilities start to become realities.

When you do a thing, do it with all your might. Put your whole soul into it. Stamp it with your own personality. Be active, be energetic, be enthusiastic and faithful, and you will accomplish your object. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” ~Ralph Waldo Emerson Do you feel enthusiastic right now? How about this morning? How about yesterday evening? Enthusiasm is a powerful “Engine” for success according to Emerson. If you’re not utilizing this it might be time to pause and reflect. In this post I want to take a look at Emerson\u0026rsquo;s quote and extract some actionable steps that can be applied. Wouldn’t it be awesome to tune up your Enthusiasm when you want? Read on\n1. You gotta be doing a thing Being static and not moving is not an option. Enthusiasm comes through doing something.\n2. Do that thing with all your might and soul Add a little soul into what you are doing. How do we add some soul? Well just listen to John Legend to get a hint. [embed]https://youtu.be/450p7goxZqg[/embed] When you have soul there emotion and a sense of deep presence in what you are doing. When I listen to John Legend perform it appears as though he is thinking about nothing else. He is here, now, playing that song.\n3. Be active, energetic, faithful Hopefully you’re not trying to be energetic the morning after 12 shots of Jose Cuervo. For me to be energetic and active I actually have to have some energy. This means taking care of my body and mind in order to be prepared to start my Enthusiasm Engine. Thanks to Emerson for leaving us some clues to activating Enthusiasm in our lives. I’m definitely planning to apply this wisdom in my own life.\nYour turn What would the impact be if you were able to put your soul into most of the work you do throughout the day?

That lesson stuck with me ever since. How do you if you are getting more of what you want in life?\nWhy would you want to keep score? Charles Coonradt, author of The Game of Work, says that scorekeeping in the workplace stimulates us to generate more positive outcomes. Think about it. Addictive games have flooded the market for iOS and Android in the past 6-7 years. The simplest games (like ninja or stack by Ketchapp) can keep a person entertained for hours. There is a natural inclination in our behavior to want to improve our score. If we can see that someone else has scored just a little more than we have, the inclination to try and beat their score probably makes it even stronger. Games work on a subconscious level.\nCan the same thing happen at work? Can we realistically apply game principles to something we do at work? Sales Managers have been implementing point systems for the longest time. Countdown timers and charity goal thermometers have been used to motivate people into action.\nAn example of scorekeeping my admin work I use a timer when I have to complete boring tasks like doing administration or preparing thousands of documents that are made from templates. I set a timer to see how many I can do within a certain limit without making mistakes. The game is simple and I repeat the cycle trying to get better each time.

Several friends have told me that this year was a good year for learning how to let go more. So that got me thinking\u0026hellip;. what does it actually mean to let go?

Second thought - On an episode of Gotham, Jim Gordon let\u0026rsquo;s Barbara, his ex-fiancee, while trying to save her from falling out of a window.

Maybe not for our own sake, but for the sake of another. Possibly someone else is really in need of our help we need to keep a tight grasp and not let them go. Sometimes we hold to something we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t. Things that have a strong sentiment from the past can be hard to let go of. It takes a lot of courage and wisdom to realize when something is no longer good for us. We might be wasting a lot energy trying to hold on. That energy could be put into something else. Letting go means facing what is - now. I sometimes fill my mind with thoughts about \u0026ldquo;what if.\u0026rdquo; There are too many possibilities to sort through. The possibilities of possibilities jumble my mind and create anxiety. In order to let go I need to take a breath, acknowledge the fact that things may not go right in the end, consider what has gone right up to this point, be grateful for that, remind myself of my purpose and focus, then move forward with what I can do right now, The hardest part for me is acknowledging that things may go all wrong in the end.

This creates a pattern record in your brain. The determining factor of whether you maintain it or not really depends on the context in which you perform and the complexity of the task. So how can you build a habit in the next five days? Strategy: Start super tiny. Step 1. Define a small action that you can start doing each day. It must be easy to repeat. Let me give you a few examples. Take one multivitamin in the morning. Drink a full glass of water as soon as you wake up. Do 10 pushups before going to bed. Step 2. Write it down somewhere you can see it each day. like your bathroom mirror or your wardrobe. Step 3. Create a tracking system for yourself. could be in your phone or on a calendar Step 4. Mark each time you complete the task that day. Go for five in a row. Step 5. After 10 days, review how you feel and see if you should continue, adjust or stop that habit. Make it something super easy that is almost impossible not to complete. Ideally you want to choose an action that is in line with your direction/goal for the year. Simple as that.

I\u0026rsquo;d like to start this issue off with a post that was published by Seth Godin, Half Measures. It\u0026rsquo;s really made me think as I review 2015 and start focusing on plans for 2016. Half Measures If you\u0026rsquo;re hungry, half a meal is better than no meal. But if you need light, half a lightbulb is actually worse than none at all. If you\u0026rsquo;re hoping for an 8% return on your investment, 4% is a lot better than zero. And half a home run is worse than nothing. We make two common mistakes: Refusing half when it\u0026rsquo;s a whole lot better than nothing, and, Accepting half when we\u0026rsquo;d be better off waiting for what we really need. We are at our best when we set our standards before the offer comes, and when we don\u0026rsquo;t waver in the moment. Think about it: Have you been waiting for something to be fully ready when half is good enough to get going?

Serena Williams, Tiger Woods, Muhammad Ali and the list goes on. The testimonials are inspiring. Before you close your eyes and imagine yourself with super big muscles, let’s take a real look at the science of visualization and how mind workout can help your fitness routine.\nWhat is visualization anyway? To put it simply, visualization is a mental rehearsal. To make it more complex, visualization uses the senses and mental imagery to create or recreate an experience in the mind. For fitness and athletics, visualization is the practice of using your mind to imagine and create a blueprint of what you would like to see in your performance to improve it and reach new levels of achievement. When you visualize something in your mind in clear detail, from particular viewpoints, your mind will react as if it were real. Imagine for a second that you are looking at your left arm and lifting your left arm up over your head. The same parts of your brain are firing up and sending signals to the muscles in your left arm. Kinda cool, right? Mind Strength and Body Strength As study done by Bishop University found that people who visualized working out were able to gain almost as much strength as a group who actually worked out. Wow! They had three groups work on developing their strength. One group was allowed to workout in the gym. A second group was only allowed to perform a mental workout and carry out their normal day’s business. A third group was not allowed to work out mentally or physically. They could just go about their daily business. The results showed that the first group increased strength by 28%. Surprisingly the second group increased strength by 24%! That’s pretty close for just visualizing a workout. Mental Practice for Actual Performance There is also the study done by Alan Richardson in Australia. He used the same three group method to test performance improvement in shooting a basketball. I could find a specific research document for this. Nevertheless, this examples is used in many posts and articles online. We see examples of these things all the time. Even top ranked tennis star Novak Djokovic talked about it as a key tool in reaching peak performance, “One of the ways is to kind of meditate but not meditate with the intention of going away from those problems, but visualize.” Djokovic knows what he is doing to prepare himself, but makes an interesting comment about mediation. How is it different than meditation, mindfulness, guided imagery, hypnosis and all that other baloney? Visualization is used in all of these practices, but these practices in themselves do not equate to visualization only. Some have more things involved. Some have less. Meditation is a form of focusing inward to quiet the mind and aim for total presence. One tries to empty thoughts and simply observe what is going on inward and outward. Mindfulness is the act of being aware of your surroundings and your own place in the universe. Guided Imagery is probably the closest thing to visualization because it takes you step-by-step through a series of scenes and settings to relax or motivate you. Hypnosis uses imagery and visualization to get the body to relax and the conscious mind to lower its barriers. Through relaxation and acceptance a hypnotist is able to make suggestions with a higher likelihood of acceptance by the conscious mind. There is a little something else you should know Visualization works really well when you are a visual person. About 65% of the population has a preference for visual images. That is what makes it so popular. However, there are some who prefer auditory or kinesthetic imagery. This is important for you to know before taking on your visualization practice. How do I know if I am visual, auditory or a kinesthetic type? A simple way to test yourself is to tell a friend about a vacation you took in the last few years. Imagine you are at the vacation spot and talk about what is around you. If the language you use is mostly about what you see, you’re probably more visual. If you describe the sound and the atmosphere, chances are you are more on the auditory side. If you describe the textures and feelings of things, you are kinesthetic. Another way is to use the free test on business balls\nHow and the heck do I visualize? Visualization is like creating a movie in your mind. You need a director, a cameraman and an audio guy. The director (aka prefrontal cortex) assess and manages the entire thing. The cameraman is your mind’s imagination. You are able to see and feel. You can zoom in and out. You can focus and unfocused certain parts. You can change also change the viewpoint like you will read about below. The audio engineer adds that dolby surround sound experience for your visualization. This really hypes up the neural networks and sends the dopamine pouring throughout your system. There are five steps to follow through a visualization exercise. 1. Relax - getting your body and mind to be calm and present. 2. Third person view - creating a mental image where you are watching yourself performance the action. 3. First person view - creating a mental image as if you have a camera on your forehead and you are performance the actions. 4. Supercharge with emotion - injecting some emotional language and feeling into your imagery to enhance the neural connections made. 5. Imagine the Outcome - seeing the final result as if it has already happened (or better as if it is happing now. For fitness, first person view is the most powerful. When you can imagine yourself, as yourself, going through the motions you are reinforcing the patterns in your brain that create the muscle memory blueprint.\nAn example Let’s imagine that you are a crossfit athlete about to do clean and press. Before you go into the actual movement you decide to use your massively developed visualization skills, not your muscles. Here is how it goes down Step 1. You relax your body using your breath and refocusing your mind on the present. Step 2. You take a first person view in your mind to imagine completing the clean and press. Step 3. You supercharge your visualizations by imagining the sensations you feel: the air, the heartbeat, the people watching, the feeling of the weight, the ground, etc. Step 4. You use your words to reinforce those feelings and describe what your sensations are. Step 5. Picture the point where you are finished the full exercise. How do you feel? What are the sensations in your body? Is anyone around cheering you on? Make it detailed. What is happening secretly As you start to imagine the scenario, your brain is sending signals down to the same parts of your brain responsible for the movement. Cool right. Of course, you’re not going to jerk your leg and shoulder while you are imagining. It’s all internal. Perfect practice makes perfect. I suggest that you go through your movements with a trainer first to make sure you are getting it right. Then go over the moves and techniques in your mind before and after your workouts. This is probably the best method for implementing visualization into your workout routine.\nWhat next Visualization for fitness activity is just the beginning. You are ahead of the game if you can combine your mental fitness with physical fitness. The next stage is in taking your game to outside world. Can you visualize your work, finances, relationships and so forth. Give it a try and you might surprise yourself how much can be achieved with a little mental rehearsal.

A part of me feels like it is a prison that I need to emerge from in order to have a real life. I know it\u0026rsquo;s not true, but it feels that way. Who ever decided that we need to work from 9am to 5pm anyway (well now it is til 6pm, right?) I know there is a better way. I\u0026rsquo;m on a mission to fight cubicle complacency and empower others to do more meaningful work. In this post I want to share 5 life design models I came across while reading about Scanners, Slashers, Multipotentialites and Shifters. Hopefully these will yield some inspiration to try changing the way you work.\n1. Remote Work Model The perfect way to be in two places at once. It is like having a presence in your office while also enjoying the cool breeze that hits your forehead while sipping an iced hibiscus tea near a wonderful beachside villa. More an more people are embracing the reality that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to be chained to a desk. Technology allows us to get most of our work and meetings done from anywhere. Give it a try.\n2. Schoolteacher Model Imagine getting summer and winter holidays. It is not just for the kids. This work model is for the person that is willing to churn out some work over a few months and take a short mini-vacation in between. It works for teachers. Could it also work for you? I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if this model would work for me. I tend to always want to pursue some passion or project year round.\n3. Double Life Model It\u0026rsquo;s okay to do more than one thing in the same day. I work on wordpress websites in the mornings and my coaching business in the afternoon. I tend to use my lunch break as a transition time to change location and my mindset. You could also do the same. Maybe one part of your day is dedicated to a skill that brings home the rent money. The next part of your day could be focused on building that body of work that you\u0026rsquo;ll be proud of 5 years from now. This type of model is great for the person who has passions that exist outside of their normal money making routine.\n4. Problem Solver Model When I worked in a larger company this tended to be my way of working. Someone would present a problem and assume it needed some training. I would go dig into the problem and figure out a way to modify the process or provide training that would update employee skills. The problem solver enjoys going from project to project and having the opportunity to help solve issues. The best part is that they don\u0026rsquo;t need to stick around for the maintenance portion of the job. That would be too boring.\n5. Rapper Model Well, not exactly \u0026ldquo;rapper,\u0026rdquo; but I thought it would be interesting. RAP (Random Acts of Passion) is where a person does not have a set project or schedule in place. Upon awakening you would tune into which one of the many passions you have and start digging into one of them them. This person probably has a rolodex of passions to choose from. Imagine a card deck of 52 passions. How would this person make money? That is a very good question to ask. Their passions would have to some how be connected to the creation of a product of some sort.\nYour Turn There are 5 different models of working for you to think about. Which one do you think fits your style best?

We want to be assertive and fully express our needs. There are a few core principles to follow when practicing your assertiveness.\nAssertiveness Principle #1 Every person has the right to express and pursue the fulfillment of his/her needs. It does not mean that their needs have to be met. At the very least there should be the respect and openness to acknowledge the needs of everyone. We have a right to have our needs heard. Being assertive ensures that you express your needs in a way that is non-aggressive, that does not hurt others.\nAssertiveness Principle #2 Assertiveness is all about finding balance, discovering your \u0026ldquo;sweet spot\u0026rdquo; in communication. Getting what you need means that you cannot be a pushover. You\u0026rsquo;re not the whimpering little puppy that can be forced into submission by the big dog. You\u0026rsquo;re also not trying to be the big dog that is barking out in way that makes people feel like they might get into a physical confrontation with you. Finding the balance between passive and aggressive communication is not easy. It takes learning, practice and reflection. There is a post on lifehack.org with some practical tips that you could try today. You could also work with me to get to your place of clarity and balance.\nAssertiveness Principle #3 Assertiveness focuses on behavior, how that behavior affects you and what change is requested. It is never abusive or insulting. Assertive communication maintains a safe pool of communication, as described in the book crucial conversation. This usually includes some formula or conversation pattern that:\nIdentifies the specific behavior Expresses how that affects you Requests a change in behavior Your Turn Do you have an assertive communication formula that you like to use?\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/10/assertiveness-principles-for-the-multipotentialites-and-scanners/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhat do you do when you are bombarded with tasks that are unappealing, not interesting?

A multipotentialite is a person with various interests and areas of expertise. This is the musician and software engineer. Could also be the marketer with knack for rock collecting. Multipotentialites have several paths and passions that they can pursue and be very good at. This makes it extremely difficult to name their one thing.

Aristotle, Leonardo Da Vinci, Tim Ferriss,\nHow is a multipotentialite different than a specialist? A specialist feels comfortable with doing one thing really well. They find their thing and fulfill their purpose doing that. This is what we are often told in personal development programs and career columns. Find your thing. Niche down and nail it.\nNiche down or Theme up As a multipotentialite I offer another way of looking at it. Rather than niching down, what if you were to theme up? Take all of your interests and find the common thread that connects it together. For me I have found joy in empowering others to shine. Whether I’m mixing a cocktail or building out a content calendar, I’ve been drawn to helping those around me find their theme and learning how to really ignite that fire.\nYour turn?

There were times when I forgot to start the song when I was working. I didn’t put the music playlist on my iphone, meaning I did not use it when I was doing work on the go. I did not want to play the music during my planning time, only my task completion time.\nLESSONS LEARNED AND BEST PRACTICES Forgive yourself if you don’t remember to turn on the song every time you work. There is no need to beat yourself up for getting to work in the first place. Put your one song into a playlist for the amount of time that you want to work. As soon as you notice the music has stopped, take a break. Put your playlist on all your devices so you can do some work anywhere Use this technique strictly for getting tasks done. Your planning and strategy time needs more flexibility and freedom. It would have been useful to find a way to measure my productivity before and after. The only measure I have right now is my productivity journal.\nDID YOU TRY?

The pomodoro technique is one of many productivity strategies aimed at keeping you focused and increasing the amount of things you get done.\nWhy would I want to try the technique? The pomodoro technique doesn’t require you to buy any folders or daily planners. You don’t even have to buy a book to get started. Simply learn the technique and go. Other benefits include:\nWorking within the time limits that you have Takes energy into account A process that eliminates burnout Helps you balance and measure your productivity Brings awareness for managing distractions. What is the pomodoro technique? The pomodoro technique is a simple system for getting things done using spaced time intervals, called “pomodoros”. There is a period of work, rest and reviewing. You simply need a piece of paper, a timer and some work that needs to get done. https://youtu.be/CT70iCaG0Gs\nWho is the pomodoro for? Managers that needs to get more done in short time blocks. Teachers that wants to teach and shift at a particular interval. Bloggers that want to get their writing done and avoid burning out. Developers that get immersed in tasks and need a reminder for when to take a break. Marketers that need to break out of the multitasking syndrome and get some good quality work done. How to get started with the technique Step 1. Choose a task that requires your full, undivided attention to get done. It can be big or small. Doesn’t matter. What matters is that you focus on one thing at a time. Examples: blog post, press release, coding, graphic design, etc. Step 2. Set your timer for 25 minutes. You can buy an egg timer or use an app like e.ggtimer.com/pomodoro I like to use my iPhone stopwatch (built in) Step 3. Get to work For the next 25 minutes you are totally absorbed with this task. You work on this task and only this task. If someone comes to distract you, make small tick next to your task. If you have to change your tasks in the middle, write it down on the paper. Step 4. When the timer rings, you mark put a check mark to indicate that you finished one cycle. If you were distracted or had to change for some reason, the pomodoro was not done. Step 5. Take a break Take a real break. Go to the water cooler for some gossip, Do some meditation, yoga or walk around. The point is to rest. Sometimes I do a little dance Step 6. Take a longer break every 4 pomodoros This is like going into halftime after you played a few quarters. The longer break will allow your brain to process things and reflect on what’s going on.\nWhat the pomodoro technique does not cover Decide which tasks are important for you to do. I recommend finding a method for deciding which tasks have priority. This might include talking with your boss or using the franklin covey matrix. Dealing with distractions. When that annoying co-worker comes up and tries to ask for your pen, you’ve got to have the communication skills to deal with that. If your client expects you to reply to email within 4 minutes, you’ll have to retrain them to respect your 25 minute block.\nLittle Extras Tell your team what you are doing so they wont distract you when you are in work mode Use the one song technique to enhance your distraction free environment Have fun with it and look at getting things done as a game.\nYour Turn Would you use the pomodoro technique?

Choosing and deciding to use one song for work means you won’t have to think about what to listen to. Your brain will associate the song with work. You can turn it on and get yourself in gear to work almost immediately. This is the behavioral conditioning part. Music has an attitude behind. Choose a song that is good for working. I’m thinking a depressive song might not be the best thing. How to take the challenge: Put the song on your Mac, iPhone and iPad for easy access. My song for the week will be “Wait Til You See My Smile” by Alicia Keys Make sure the song can repeat. I created a playlist in itunes that only has this song. It’s called “workjam.” If I am at my computer I can set it to repeat one inside itunes. A little extra: I copy the song the number of times I want it to play before I need to take a break. I’ll explain why in another post. Play the song when ever it is time for you to work. Share your progress. Leave a comment below or send me a note. YOUR TURN What song did you choose?

The emergence of udemy, coursera, and many other online learning platforms prove that there will be a strong movement to sharing knowledge online. Today, I wanted to try and build a course in 30 minutes using fedora. I failed. It took me 54 minutes to do it. Still not too bad. In this post I want to share my initial impressions about using the system, when it might be best to give it a try, and any special quirks that I didn\u0026rsquo;t particularly like.\nWhat is fedora? Fedora is an online platform that helps independent course builders quickly create courses that can be sold online. They handle the hosting and payment processing so that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about it. This can be a real time-saver if you are not familiar with how to do all this. It is an easy way to get an online school started without spending a lot of time worrying about the technical aspects.\nWho else uses fedora? I\u0026rsquo;ve created a test course here if you want to check it out. Other examples include Stack Social, Ryan Leslie, and Charlie Hoehn.\nWhat I like about fedora. I like the simplicity that fedora brings to its system. The user interface is clean and intuitive overall. Users will be able to find their course tasks very easy without fumbling around too much. Teachers will be able to upload their course materials without worrying about messing things up. Easy to make changes with content. As a teacher it is extremely easy to upload content and put it in the right order. When I first started creating courses I did not make separate sections. I just jumped right in and started making \u0026ldquo;lectures,\u0026rdquo; as they call it. When I finished uploading the content I realized that I wanted to separate the lessons into 3-4 groups. It was really easy to do this with some drag and drop. They have a free plan. A free plan is perfect for someone that is getting started and doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a website. You will have to handover 10% per sale though. Coupons and Memberships. This is a good feature for those that want to hold special discounts and create recurring subscriptions. The site is fast. Even using the site in China it is still relatively fast. I can expand it into a multi-teacher school. I like the idea of being able to scale and grow the school that I create on fedora.\nWhat I don\u0026rsquo;t like about fedora. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have the marketing appeal of udemy. This can be a turn off if you are just starting out and want to build an audience with your courses. Paying 10%+$1 per transaction for a course enrollment. They have to pay the bills. I get it. However a large percentage cut for hosting my content always makes me want to think of a future exit strategy. Discussions. Discussions are currently limited to Disqus. I would rather have had a built in discussion system. Sometimes users don\u0026rsquo;t want to have their lesson discussions shared all over. Quizzing. The quiz tools on the free plan are really weak. I hope they are better in the upgraded versions.\nWho should use fedora? People with an audience. If you already have an audience, this platform will make it super easy to get on online course setup and make it available to your clan. Without an audience you will be spending much more money and effort trying to drive traffic to your courses. This may lead to your profit margins being eaten away by the hosting monsters. Someone without a primary site. If you are just starting out and don\u0026rsquo;t want to go down the road of installing wordpress and yadda yadda stuff. This will be an easy way to get started and have a presence online. You could use the fedora blog or start blogging on linkedin and medium to drive people to your site full of wonderful course goodness.\nConfused about where to begin? There are many online course delivery platforms out there. Knowing which one to start with and how to get your course going can take some time. I\u0026rsquo;ve been playing around with different systems for years. Contact me if you want some guidance about where to begin.\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/09/review-using-fedora-as-your-online-course-platform/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eEveryone has something that they could share.

Tai Chi. They seem like two separate things. One is part of the unconventional fitness movement growing around the globe. Another is a slow, meditative practice with mysterious beginnings. I\u0026rsquo;ve been combining the two for about 10 days now. Upon reflection, they have taught me some interesting lessons about how to move forward with building my own coaching \u0026amp; digital product business. I\u0026rsquo;d like to share some of the insights:\n1. Relaxed is probably right When learning tai chi at the base of the wudang mountain, my teacher said that i should follow a relaxed and natural motion. When learning about kettle bell swinging with Habi, one of the leaders of the CoreControl Movement, he said that I should keep the shoulder relaxed and follow a natural motion. Takeaway: Relaxed doesn’t mean lazy and inactive. It means finding your natural flow and staying in tune with it. This is something that I have added to the attuning model and process.\n2. It takes time to work itself out In both Kettle bell and tai chi workouts, you must practice consistently for a certain amount of time. The kinks and blocks will work themselves out. Usually this will take the form of some pain or strain. Your body will adjust if you are dong the third lesson. Takeaway: Take note of the the pain and strain you are feeling. It’s not just there to make you feel bad. It could be there to make you more aware of a shift you need to make. Sometimes it might just mean you need to work harder and get stronger. Wisdom is what helps you know whether to push through or adjust.\n3. Focus leads to improvement When swinging the kettle bell I must focus. When doing tai chi I must focus. There are 3 things that need to be focused: Body, Breath and Mind. Sure, you could do the exercise without focus, but the gains would be a lot less. It would also increase the likelihood of injury while doing it. Takeaway: Find what it takes for you to get focused and to remain focused. You are much more productive when you focus on the task at hand while you are doing. We’ve seen a multitude of books on the topic of focus and the inner games that disrupt that. Focusing is like a muscle that needs development and growth. There are reminders all around us, in everything we do . These three lessons are just the beginning. I expect more to emerge as I continue practicing and trying new things.\nYour Turn Have you tried swinging a kettle bell? Go try it this week. Even better, use it as part of your six minute morning routine. Never tried Tai Chi? There are a ton of youtube videos available that can get you started. I personally do the Wudang Taiji 13 form.

I’ve noticed a very powerful thing about myself and the people I work with- we all have very similar goals and struggles. I would be rich if I got 10 kuai every time someone told me, “I just want to be happy.” I am often asked about my own personal tactics for various issues and problems.\n“Is there an app I could use to help keep myself accountable?” “What should I tell my boss to express my frustration?” The thing is that when it comes to making a change from within, getting yourself to wake up and move, there are some challenges that any of the best practices, tactics and strategies I give you can’t overcome on their own. Let me give you an example of what I mean. A letter from a young man who desperately wants to stop procrastinating on his work but can’t seem to do it.\nThe Letter Dear Paris, “I know this may be hard to believe…. but I REALLY want to stop procrastinating and get work done and find projects that are meaningful to me. For some reason I just can’t get myself to do it. I am constantly yelling at myself in my head, telling myself: ‘just get started and get the d*mn thing done!’ ‘Try break it down into a super small task so it is easy enough to do.’ ‘Spend 3 minutes on it, then 8 minutes, then 20 minutes until you are done.’ I do this SO MUCH. No one believes me though. My boss says that if I REALLY want to be more productive then I stop complaining about it and start getting the stuff done. That if I really care about the work that I do, I would just do it. I do care. I know how to be productive, that isn’t the problem. I know that I can prioritize my tasks, make to do lists, take a short break and do pre-work routine. Again, I’ve read all the books, attended your training courses. The HOW is not the problem that I am having. What I need help with is making myself MOVE on these things. I’m passionate about the work that I do. I know what to do, but don’t know how to motivate myself to get going. So, I procrastinate. I know that if I get this task done, I can relax and feel good about it. I know that my boss is usually pleased with the work that I do when it is complete. I miss deadlines because I procrastinate. What’s wrong with me? How come no matter how much I yell at myself and tell myself to go do it, I just keep sitting here staring at my screen and looking through WeChat moments until the last minute of the day? Is there something wrong with me? Is there anything I can do to get motivated? Lazy Louis We’ve all felt this way before. Me included. We will say that we are being lazy or unmotivated when we don\u0026rsquo;t do what we are supposed to do. Because if we REALLY, REALLY wanted to it, we would just do it, right?\nLet’s keep digging into it Desire is not his problem. He really wants to get things done. He is passionate about the work he does. Lack of knowledge is not his problem. He knows the techniques and tactics to do things but doesn’t do it. Motivation is not the problem , although he thinks it is. He is motivated by the desire to get things done. His boss is usually pleased, he definitely wants to stop beating himself up about it and feeling bad. We do this to ourselves all the time. We scold ourselves about lack of desire, motivation or ability. Yet, as the example above illustrates, none of those things are the real problem. There is something else paralyzing us, keeping us from moving and getting things done that are important to us. We are paralyzed by fear, anxiety and stress… including things like Fear of failure: “I don’t want to try and start the task because I\u0026rsquo;ll just procrastinate again. The procrastination will just prove that I always do it and never get stuff done on time.” Fear of succeeding: “If I finish it too soon, my boss will think I don’t have enough to do and will give me even more work. Then my life will be even more stressful.” Fear of judgement: “I am not the best person to be doing this task, I’m not the expert. I’ll feel like a fraud or imposter for doing it.” It is much easier to ignore these fears than to actually fight and overcome them.\nThe point Procrastination, inaction, and “being lazy” aren’t the core problems; they are just symptoms we see on the surface. The core is our fear and anxiety. Many of our training programs and blog posts address the symptoms, not the problems. So we experience the same thing again and again. Over time, habits form and we start to think that this is really part of who we are. “I’m lazy” “I suck at work” “I am not a motivated person”\nSTOP! This is a toxic state mind. It’s destructive. I am guilty of having it too. When I started going for a walk as part of my morning routine, the thought of getting dressed and going outside paralyzed me. I would walk around the block and see the same people every day. I would tell myself, “I’m a black guy living in China. This walk isn’t going to make much difference. It will only make more people stare at me. They will stare and wonder what I am doing every morning walking the same way so early. I must be crazy.” It’s just not true. The truth is that the people who WAKE UP and MOVE forward experience the exact same fears and anxieties we all do. Exhale and know that you are not alone. The difference is that they have learned how to PROCESS through the emotions in a different way. YOU CAN DO THE SAME!\nHow to get started By this point you are probably interested in learning how to process those fears and doubts so that they can no longer hold you back. To do this you need a combination of three things: THINK DIFFERENT SPEAK DIFFERENT ACT DIFFERENT Let me get you started with one of these things. Take the next action steps to start turning things around. Become a changer that actually gets it to stick.\nYour Turn SPEAK DIFFERENT The words we say internally and externally really do have power. Ramit Sethi talks about invisible scripts on his blog. I learned a lot from his content. Check it out when you have some time. In the meantime, take the following actions below.\nAction #1 Think back to a time when you last procrastinated on something. Maybe you were trying to wake up early or finish a press release or send out a client invoice. For some reason you decided to procrastinate. What were you telling yourself in your head? List out what was being said. Examples: “I’ve got to get this done. I will sit here and just hammer it out” “This is easy to do. I should stop being lazy” “I’m not focused enough yet to write a good quality press release” “I really wish the client would give me more details so I could write this faster” “My boss is going to be calling in soon if I don’t send it over to him for review. I should stop staring at my screen and start writing” “I really should get out of bed. Don’t hit the snooze button. Don’t hit the snooze!” Any of this sound familiar? This is negative self-talk\nAction #2 For the next 10 days, be more aware of when this internal talk happens. Each time you hear yourself saying something like this, change the wording around to something more positive. For example: Instead of “I’m being lazy” try “I’m fine.” Rather than saying “I’m not focused enough yet” try “Will doing X get me more focused and started?”\nAction #3 Leave a comment on this post and tell me how it went.\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/08/why-cant-i-just-do-it/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been coaching and training for more than 10 years now.

Your worries about stress don’t have to do with stress at all. Stress is your body’s response to some change, problem or transition. It is meant to keep you safe from harm or gear up for a task at hand. **So why do I feel so bad when you say “I’m stressed?” **Good Question.

[ted id=1815 lang=zh-cn]\nHow do I get started with Mastering my Stress without leaving my cubicle? This is why you are reading this post, right. You want to know how to become a stress master without having leave your cozy cubicle. I will share 3 things that I actively do to keep my stress levels under control. Tactic 1. Stop working every 50 – 80 minutes. I pulse my work/rest cycles throughout the day so that my body has time to recover and refresh itself. This is not only beneficial for my body, but also for my mind. A cycle of work and rest helps keep your body from going into distress. Tactic 2. Focus on my breath. Almost every guide on relaxation will tell you to breath in a certain way. It is an effective way for me to relieve tension. It also gives me something to focus on Bang my head on the desk. Just kidding. Please don’t do this. Tactic 3. Make some tea. The art of making tea helps me get focused. It also creates the space and time needed to let my mind think about things in a different way. I can always invite someone to come over and join me for tea. It\u0026rsquo;s an invitation for dialogue.\nDon’t stop with just doing things in your cubicle. Mastering your stress is not about only doing certain things. You must go through the process of really understanding and becoming familiar with your relationship to stress. Stress, Anxiety, Fear, Worry, Doubt\u0026hellip; All these things are connected with the mastery of self. In addition to trying the tactics above, also consider these steps:\nTune IN to your stressors Tune IN to your purpose for doing what your doing Retune your perspective and story Retune your fears and worries Tune up your confidence to ask for what you need Tune up your abilities to be more productive Want to know how to do these things?

Without stress we would not be able to stretch ourselves or achieve anything that matters. The idea of living in complete stasis with no disturbances is a myth. We need to contribute to something. We need to do something that matters to us. There are many tools on the market that claim to help you reduce stress. Have you seen the water goggles? I’m not sure what they do. Or what about the massage chair? That will definitely cool you down. The truth is that you don’t need any of these things. All you really need are the God given tools that are built inside you. The best explanation and breakdown for these tools that I have found are in Jude Bijiou’s book, Attitude Reconstruction. It has been an important work in my research on Attuning. I want to give you a quick summary of those tools below. Emotion Emotion is part of what we feel in response to a stimulus outside of us. This tool can propel us forward or it can drag us down. It depends on how we use it. Think of Denzel Washington in Man on Fire. His emotion became a fuel for getting justice. You see this theme constantly in Steven Seagal films. The key point is that emotion needs an outlet. This outlet can come physically or vocally. If it stays bottled up inside, it will destroy you. Thought Thoughts are things. They are the perspective that our conscious mind allows to fill that part of the brain behind our forehead. The interesting thing about humans is that we have the ability to override our instinctive reactions and thoughts. When we feel fear or anxiety there is an option for us to disassociate and evaluate what we want to do about it. That is an awesome thing. As far as I know other animals are not able to do this. Intuition This is one of the trickiest tools. Accessing our intuition is simple, yet not easy. Emotion and thought can cloud our ability to listen to our intuition. Speech The ability speak things into existence is unique to us. “Life and death lie in the power of the tongue. Therefore, speak life!” the Bible tells us. What kind of words are you speaking on a regular basis? Did you know what we say most of the time probably has materialized into our reality? Speaking of lack brings lack. Speaking of abundance brings abundance. Action The last and most physical part of our toolkit is action. What we do with the other four tools is what matters in the end. You could analyze and evaluate internally all you want. The actions you take in the end are what matter most. So do something.

In this post I’d like to share 8 simple tips you can apply almost immediately when you feel overwhelmed by stress.\nNot all stress is bad Remember that there is a certain amount of stress that we need to feel inspired and get moving on a new project. In an earlier post I wrote about the two types of stress. We can leverage this positive tension to be more creative and productive in our work. However, we must also be aware of when this energy peaks and insert the proper breakthrough strategy.\nThe tips Tip #1 breathing pattern 4-7-8 This is becoming a well known breathing pattern to prepare your body to fall asleep. It can also be used to help destress a bit. Tip #2 toss something between your right and left hand. Start out by giving your stress level a number between 1 and 10. Then watch the object and pass it back and forth between your left and right hand. Do this for about 30 seconds, pause, then repeat. Tip #3 Acknowledge the stress This tip seems very obvious, but it is usually the last thing that we want to do when the feeling hits. Verbally acknowledging what is giving you stress allows you to step away from the moment and disassociate from it. Tip #4 Drink a glass of water Whenever I tend to get deep into a project I forget to eat and drink. I get dehydrated and that brings me more stress. Grab a glass of water and take a break.

Have you ever wondered why? Does it even matter why? What would happen if you shifted your perspective from weaknesses to only looking at your strengths? This week I ran a workshop with several leaders on leveraging their strengths rather than looking at their weaknesses. It was a very productive day. We were able to look at an entirely different perspective for the team. Rather than looking at the team as something to be fixed, we began asking questions about how do we evolve and make a bigger impact with what we do well already.\nThe appeal of weaknesses Looking at weaknesses gives a false sense of why you are not reaching peak performance. Someone you respect gives you some feedback, “hey! you need to work on that.” After hearing a comment to work on your weakness there is a need to “fix” what has been broken. As humans, we like fixing things. It’s easier for us to look at what has gone wrong rather than celebrate and innovate what is going right.\nThe difficulty with strengths There are no limits with strengths - only milestones. If you are an expert at writing press releases and quarterly reports, what would be your next step? Would you leverage that strengths to grow and make a bigger impact? I ask these type of questions when I have a client take the strengthsfinder assessment. It’s not easy to abstract from where you currently are and aim for a next level that you can’t even imagine yet.\nHow to start focusing on your strength If you don’t have the budget to take a strengthsfinder assessment then make your own. Make a list of things you feel enable you to do your best at what you do. Then ask some trusted colleagues what they feel are your best strengths. Make this a separate list. Combine the lists together and look at all the strengths that you have. Take a moment to acknowledge yourself and appreciate where you are. Select 1-2 of those strengths and consider where you could use them in a different context. For example, if you are awesome at writing press releases you might be able to expand that strength into particular industry style of press release. You could possibly build on the strength of writing and decide to take on a project that requires writing a feature article. Build and Stack. Your turn Do you focus on your strengths? Or are you still working on improving your weaknesses?\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/07/are-you-leveraging-your-strengths-or-strengthening-your-weaknesses/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe corporate performance word has been designed for us to focus on your weakness rather than leveraging and propelling our strengths. Have you ever wondered why? Does it even matter why? What would happen if you shifted your perspective from weaknesses to only looking at your strengths? This week I ran a workshop with several leaders on leveraging their strengths rather than looking at their weaknesses. It was a very productive day. We were able to look at an entirely different perspective for the team. Rather than looking at the team as something to be fixed, we began asking questions about how do we evolve and make a bigger impact with what we do well already.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Are you leveraging your strengths or strengthening your weaknesses?"},{"content":"Do you know the difference between a coach and a mentor? If not, that’s okay. This post will keep it simple and make things clear for you. Knowing the difference between the two can save you a lot of time and effort in your decision-making. You might be working with a mentor and not even know it. You might be paying for a coach and not even need it. I searched the web and discovered many different descriptions, definitions and explanations between coaching and mentoring. There are many overlaps in the skills that coaches and mentors use. The simplest distinction that I have found between the two is experience and advice. Since I’m in China I always wonder what the difference might be in Chinese words as well. I’ve included them in this post.\nWhat is a mentor? Mentor = 导师(dao3shi1) The Chinese word for mentor defines it well. Mentor” implies advising and directing actions. A mentor is a trusted advisor with experience that aligns with the path their mentee is seeking to pursue. A good mentor has the ability to see the potential that you have, the path that is in front of you and provide guidance on how to navigate that course. It is still up to the mentee to decide what action to take, but the mentor serves as a wise sounding board. A mentor will probably use coaching skills bring out the best in their mentee. Quotes help illustrate and articulate the definition:\n“One of the greatest values of mentors is the ability to see ahead what others cannot see and to help them navigate a course to their destination.” ~John C. Maxwell “A mentor is someone who sees more talent and ability within you, than you see in yourself, and helps bring it out of you.” ~Bob Proctor “The delicate balance of mentoring someone is not creating them in your own image, but giving them the opportunity to create themselves.” ~ Steven Spielberg\nWhat is a coach? Coach = 教练 (jiao4lian4) In mandarin the word for coach still relates to sports and physical training. Many professional coaches are adding prefixes to the word in Chinese. For example, Life coach is 生活教练 (shenghuojiaolian) which literally is life-coach. I feel that a better way of describing is coach is closer to “facilitator(主持人 = zhu3chi2ren2).” A coach is a facilitator that helps takes you through the process of seeing what you cannot see. Then the coach will guide you through the steps of defining actions and taking actions needed to achieve your aim. A coach uses powerful questions, active listening, direct communication and accountability to facilitate you. Yep! A few more quotes to solidify:\n\u0026ldquo;I never cease to be amazed at the power of the coaching process to draw out the skills or talent that was previously hidden within an individual, and which invariably finds a way to solve a problem previously thought unsolvable.\u0026rdquo; ~John Russell \u0026ldquo;Probably my best quality as a coach is that I ask a lot of challenging questions and let the person come up with the answer.\u0026rdquo; ~Phil Dixon \u0026ldquo;A good coach will make his players see what they can be rather than what they are.\u0026rdquo; ~Ara Parasheghian \u0026ldquo;You get the best effort from others not by lighting a fire beneath them, but by building a fire within.\u0026rdquo; ~Bob Nelson\nThe key difference The key difference between a coach and a mentor is experience and relationship. A mentor has been down the path that you are on and will be invested in seeing you discover your own parallel path. A coach excellent at helping you get unstuck in a particular situation, define your direction and take the first steps to get moving.\nAre they interchangeable? A mentor can take the role of a coach, but a coach may not always be a mentor.\nYour turn Can you be coached or mentored through a book or video? Are there any Chinese quotes about the difference between a coach and a mentor? I’m curious to find some. How have you leveraged a coach or mentor in the past? Also, if you disagree with the way I\u0026rsquo;ve describe things here then please let me know. I\u0026rsquo;m open to a discussion. The more we dialogue the better our understanding.

If you want to live a long life, you need eustress, that is, a deep sense of meaning and of contribution to worthy projects and causes, particularly, your intergenerational family.” ~Stephen Covey Not all stress is bad. I used to believe that I wanted to eliminate all stress in my life. I wanted to be stress free and full of glee. Boy was I wrong. Rather than seeking to eliminate stress once and for all, I found that it is much more constructive to acknowledge and appreciate stress for what it is, then make it work in my favor. This post is all about understanding what stress is and how to identify attributes of the two types.\nWhat is stress? Stress is a physiological response to any change that alerts your brain and body to trigger a fight or flight response – aka the “uh oh” trigger. The “uh oh” trigger can be good or bad. When I wake up in the morning and start to do a wall sit as part of my morning routine - that is stress. When my boss send me an email with that red exclamation point next to it, and I almost s**t my pants because I remembered that I forgot the cover sheet on my last report – that is stress too. Stress is simply the physical and mental response to some shift/change. The response that we have can either lead us to perform better or fall out.\nThe two types of stress to recognize Type 1: EUSTRESS Attributes: Clarity, Focus, Motivated, Energized This is the good kind of stress. Usually rising from an incite. This type of stress gets you moving and creating. You feel energized and challenged just enough to maintain the desire keep progressing. This is after-workout-creative-inspiration kind of stress. This is the “I can do that” incite. This is the “dunk on them (in Dikembe Mutombo’s voice)” feeling on a fast break. A little background: Way back in 1908 two Harvard researchers, Robert Yerkes and John Dodson, found that efficiency increased as stress increased, but only to a certain point. Then there was the second type of stress.\nType 2: DISTRESS Attributes: overwhelm, anxiety, fatigue, procrastination, tired This is the kind that will burn you out if you are not careful. The stress you feel becomes more like an overwhelming weight above you that can’t be held for long. It’s just a matter of time before you get crushed. This is the “oh my gosh” feeling. The “how can I possibly do this” feeling. The “I just can’t deal with this right now” feeling. The “he is going to pin it to the backboard. Those are the two types of stress that we can experience. One is a good, motivating type. The other is an enervating, defeating state of being. Understanding the two types of stress is the first step to making it work for you.

One question stood out above the rest: and it is a silly one. That is what I’d like to share today. The question is:\nWhat’s your stinky tofu? Those living in China will probably know what I’m talking about. However those not in china may need to be brought up to speed.\nWhat the heck is stinky tofu? Stinky Tofu is a fermented tofu snack typically sold at night markets or on the street in China. This delicious snack has a pungent odor you will recognize from blocks away, assuming you are standing upwind.If you can get past the stinky part you will find a delightful snack to enjoy.\nWhat does it have to do with finding a joy job? All work stinks in some shape or form. Some work is worth it. Some is worth running away from. This is an individual choice. For example, PR professionals work long hours, dealing with random changes from clients, and high pressure deadlines. And the pros that I speak with love it.Not everyone can do it. Not everyone should do it. What are you willing to go through in order to have joy in your work? What kind of work would be worth embracing what stinks around?\nMy example I love running a professional coaching practice and facilitating 1-1 or in small groups The stink: admin, accounting work, keeping up with sales/marketing, no steady paycheck at the moment, occasional surge of fear, anxiety and doubt. The good taste: Working with a person 1-on-1 to breakthrough their stress and anxiety is work that matters to me. Being with a group of people and facilitating them through learning and change feels right. With an open acknowledgement and appreciative mind you will be able ask yourself, “Is what I am doing worth all getting past the stink?”\nIf yes, you’ve found your stinky tofu.

It pretty important to know how we want to ideally spend 83,200 hours of our life. I spent some time looking into this question. My thoughts are a bit contrary to popular opinion. I\u0026rsquo;ll be very direct\nStop looking for your dream job. There are tons of articles out there that discuss the opposite (you can find some in the links below). There are many courses about how to find your dream job. Heck, I even bought a domain name about finding a dream job in anticipation of creating a course about the topic. After looking into many methods and theories I’ve come to the opinion that going out to find a dream job is mostly an illusion.\nThe reality of landing a job Work is still work regardless of where and what you are doing. We are sweet talked into an almost perfect package and given just enough benefits to make us feel secure. Keyword is feel.\nThe reality of a dream job (assuming it exists) In the ideal sense of a dream job I would be sitting on the beach sipping a pina colada, getting paid to watch the waves flow. I would feel the breeze run over my semi bald head and take in the fresh air. That would be the dream, right. The reality is If I were paid to do that I would be bored in 10 days. Wouldn’t you? We need work, we need to be engaged, we need to feel like we are doing something that matters. Rather than looking for a dream job what you should do is:\nFind work that brings you joy or discover joy in the work that you are doing now. Below are some steps to get you going:\n1. Know where you stand. It’s vague, I know. What I mean by that is understanding the background that drives you to work. Knowing your care about and drivers will allow you to narrow down the possibilities of work that will bring you joy. Take inventory of your\nvalues beliefs skills work style experiences that have brought you joy NOTE: I\u0026rsquo;ve developed a collection of worksheets around these inventories. Message me if you would like to receive a copy. An example: Integrity is one of my core values. When I work for a company or do a job for a client have to check if the company is holding true to what they say they are and what they say they do. I also need to know if my values are in harmony with where the company is going. If it feels out of tune I will get physically ill. Really. 2. What’s your stinky tofu? This is China reference. for those who don’t know, stinky tofu is fried tofu cubes that smell horrible. It will hit you like a brick if you standing if the wind blows your way and there is a tofu stand in your path. However, this snack is also very tasty. If you can get past the smell then you will have a nice reward. Work is the same way. All work stinks in some shape or form. Some work is worth it. This is an individual choice. PR professionals work long hours, take chaotic changes from clients, and battle busyness all day long. And they love it. Not everyone can do it. Not everyone should do it. What are you willing to go through in order to have a small reward on the end? What kind of work would be worth embracing what stinks around? For me, creating guides and courses that wake people up and inspire them to get moving is totally worth it. The stink: admin, accounting work, keeping up with sales/marketing, no steady paycheck at the moment, occasional surge of fear, anxiety and doubt. The good taste: Working with a person 1-on-1 to breakthrough their stress and anxiety is work that matters to me. Being with a group of people and facilitating them through learning and change feels right.\n3. Actively reach out to the places you want to be. Don’t wait for a job to be posted. Most of the good positions are never advertised. Start connecting and contacting people that work for the companies that align with your values and work style. Who you know becomes important when you are looking for meaningful work. Some practical steps:\nMake a list of 5 companies that fit your criteria. Determine if you know anyone in those companies that can give you some insight. If you know someone, reach out and buy them a coffee to learn more about the company If you don’t, find a way to meet a recruiter or leader in that company. LinkedIN can be a powerful tool for this. Join a common interest group. Send an email requesting a interview. YES you can do this. The Muse offers some excellent tips about the art of asking for an informational interview. I’ll highlight the key points How to ask for an informational interview Ask for help - Literally say something like, “I’m really hoping you’ll be able to help me out…” or \u0026ldquo;I’d love your help…\u0026rdquo; Be clear - ask for something specific like, “I’d love to take you out for a tea\u0026quot; Have a hook - demonstrate why you want to meet with them by connecting to what makes them stand out. Be super considerate - lay down a line or two that appreciates them taking time out of their busy schedule. Don’t seem desperate for a job - you get the point. I remember in college I reached out to Ty Howard because I admired what he was doing in the speaking industry. I had a breakfast chat with him and it ended up becoming an internship that taught me so much. 4. Start a mini project Things start to happen when you decide to wake up and get going. Even if you are in a job you don’t like so much, start something that would bring you joy. 9 times out of 10 no one will stand in your way if it is adding value. This is an effective way to make your current work more meaningful. How to do it?\nfind a problem that disturbs you in your office, team or company make a list of people and resources you need to create a solution or execute on that solution Get around those people and see if they have interest in working on the project. Go do it. Tell people about the great solution you are creating. Celebrate the small wins as you progress. Work that brings joy begins with us. BAM! Go do it.

BUT Here it is. Keep reading to find out how I got it done. The “I don’t feel like it” mood infects us all. If it is strong enough to take control we may find ourselves in a spiral procrastination: missed deadlines, more pressure, disengaged work. Lots of stress. I’d like to share some thoughts from my research and personal experimentation to combat this thing. A Question: What technique works for you? Reply to this email and let me know. Here are five steps I have been taking to get past the “I don’t feel like it” mood:\nStep 1. Tune IN to where the feeling is coming from. Lifehacker and HBR give us a few insights on why we feel the way we do. There are four possible reasons:\nAnxiety - anticipating what happens when you actually do the task. There could be a fear of making a mistake or simply not wanting to do what comes after you are done. Motivation - similar to the shiny object syndrome. You see something else you’d rather be doing. For about three weeks I was lassoed into watching episodes of the \u0026lsquo;Walking Dead.’ Don’t ask me why - stop distracting me… just kidding. Willpower - straight up gusto for wanting to do something. Typically when a task might be too challenging or too boring your will to get going is reduced. Poor Time Management - we haven’t been managing our time correctly and this makes the feeling arise. For me I discovered that my feeling would come from being distracted by other interesting things. Once you identify your the source of your mood shift, move on to step two. Step 2. Acknowledge your feeling OUT LOUD and what you want to do about it. For example, “I know i don’t want to write this blog post right now, I’d rather be thinking about the next season of walking dead that doesn’t come out till September, but this feeling has no control over me and I am going get moving with my work” Something like that. Like Oliver Burkeman asked in his book, Antidote: \u0026ldquo;Physically, nothing is stopping you – you just don\u0026rsquo;t feel like it…Who says you need to wait until you \u0026lsquo;feel like\u0026rsquo; doing something in order to start doing it?\u0026rdquo; Surely we’ve learned that acting on feeling alone is not the the recipe for success. It takes a little more.\nStep 3. Check your body Are you physically tired and simply need to take 20 minutes to yourself? If so, do that. Rest is super important to peak performance. Are you hydrated? Make sure you drink water. I like to drink a glass of water as part of my pre-work routine - it’s part of the step 5.\nStep 4. Apply a strategy for shifting your thinking Are you too focused on trying to make the result perfect? It might be time to shift to a more preventative strategy. Yea… that’s right. Don’t focus on achievement; instead you should be focused on what you’re preventing by getting things done. Research shows that preventative mindset actually makes you ready to do the task. So instead of thinking about how your boss will be so impressed by your work, think about how you’ll avoid that annoying “hows that…. thing going?” email.\nStep 5. Do a pre-work routine. James Clear took his cue from baseball, I discovered mine playing basketball. Does sports teach us how to prepare for getting things done? When I used to play basketball tournaments I would have a very specific routine for warming up my body and mind to play. It didn’t matter how I felt. I was able to trigger the readiness by having this routine in place. Last thing - change the order as needed. This is just the way I did it. It may work a little differently for you.\nreferences: http://jamesclear.com/how-to-get-motivated - James Clear http://lifehacker.com/what-to-do-when-you-just-dont-feel-like-working-1531571265 - lifehacker https://hbr.org/2014/02/how-to-make-yourself-work-when-you-just-dont-want-to - HBR http://zenhabits.net/moody/ - zenhabits http://www.prolificliving.com/i-dont-feel-like-it-syndrome/ - prolific living http://amzn.to/1BYwnW9 - Oliver Burkeman’s Antidote book\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/06/when-you-dont-feel-like-it/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026ldquo;Who says you need to wait until you \u0026lsquo;feel like\u0026rsquo; doing something in order to start doing it?” ~\u003cstrong\u003eOliver Burkman\u003c/strong\u003e\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like writing this post.

My intention for going to the mountain was two fold:\nTo fulfill a childhood dream of learning some kung fu in the mountains To practice presence I came away with a few lessons. I want to dive into the idea of doing nothing. Most people interpret the words of doing nothing as living an idle, inactive life. Almost the same way we check out in the middle of a boring lecture. If that were the case, the quote above would not make sense at all unless one had absolutely nothing to do. We know that is not the case. Living our lives gives us more than we can handle in a 24 hour period of time. We live in a day and age where are work is demanding more and paying less. I won’t get on a soapbox. I will say that something has pushed us to the extreme end of activity. The idea of being idle and doing nothing for once has an appeal, right? The daoist lesson of doing nothing and leaving nothing undone has reminded me that we need to work with balance and presence. It’s not easy. What doing nothing means for me: Being present. The act of doing nothing yields a certain level of presence in wherever we are so that we are only focused on the moment at hand, the task at hand. There is an effortlessness in doing something with full present attention. Eliminating unnecessary thoughts ( \u0026amp; tasks). Adding to the idea of doing nothing comes with the act of elimination, where some things - most things - will be left not done. The choice in doing your one most important things allows you to focus. Leaving nothing undone. We will be able to stay in that present moment, acting in flow and finishing when we finish. The action of breaking a task down to such simplicity that it can feel effortless and when you are done, you know it.\nYour Turn So when your boss comes over to distract you from being present in your work.

During his short lived life he tested many theories and dispelled myths about how we live and act. Self discipline was a key component of his philosophy. If Bruce Lee was running a habits workshop, what would he share? Unfortunately, Bruce Lee is not here today to speak. Fortunately, much of his wisdom has been captured in his books, videos, and students. Lesson #1 Admit when you are making mistakes\n\u0026ldquo;Mistakes is forgivable if one has the courage to admit them.\u0026rdquo; We all make mistakes. Yet there is a part of us that always wants to hide and shy away from that mistake. Think about at work. Have you ever convinced yourself that one small error is too small to bring up or admit? If you just wait long enough it might go away, right? Judgements can lead to a habit of mistake masking. Lesson #2 Narrow your focus and get really good at it \u0026ldquo;I fear not the man who has practiced 10 000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10 000 times.\u0026rdquo; With Youtube readily available at my fingertips it is really easy for me to try and learn many different things. Having a multitude of information to access is empowering. However, I must take care not to lose focus on my one thing. Doing one thing well is more powerful than trying 10,000 different things a little. This wisdom is especially valuable for the generalist. Lesson #3 Refine and customize to you \u0026ldquo;absorb what is useful, discard what is not, add what is uniquely your own\u0026rdquo; Wow! This quote gave me an aha moment when I first read it. And it also impacts me today. For example while working on the six minute morning program, i am doing just that. There are so many experiences and strategies that could be captured and shared. In the end, the most value comes from how I filter the information and make it unique. My hope is that people will absorb what is useful from what I share and add their own unique style to it.\nYour turn Do you have a favorite Bruce Lee quote that applies habit change and life achievement?\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/06/bruce-lee-method-of-change/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eBruce Lee\u0026rsquo;s was wise beyond his years.

There is a caveat. I don’t believe I am the only one that is able to do many different things generally well. A \u0026ldquo;practitioner of many and master of none\u0026rdquo; come to mind. Being able to do many things has benefits when it is time to get something started. However, to really get focused and master one thing is not very easy. Too much talent can lead to a lack of focus. Two Signs that your talent is causing you to be unfocused. Sign 1. Trying out several new things at one time and never completing When you have so many different areas of interest and capability it is really easy to be distracted by one other thing that you would like to try and see if it is for you. I’ve started countless mini websites and lost interest within the first 3 months. How distracted do you get when you are trying to focus on something? If you find yourself starting many different things and not much getting complete, this can be a problem. What to do:\nMake a working folder that you place any projects or activities you are working on in. On a computer I have a folder called “working” under my documents. This will store any of my major projects that I’m tackling at the moment. Make the project small enough that you will realistically complete it before moving on to (or get distracted by) something else. Give yourself a limit to how many things you can work on at one time. Once the project is done, move it out of the working folder to an archive of some kind. I use one drive and hard drive to back up my this stuff. Add the next thing. Reason 2. Creating disparate social circles. This can be a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it. Rather than having one group of friends that enjoys playing video games. I am connected to the techies, dancers, artists, muscle heads and tea lovers. I love these groups. The challenge is that all of your friends and associates will want to do things regularly. This can be a time drain. Your weekend schedule will start to be look busier than your work schedule. This is an indicator that your talent may be pulling you into too many directions. What to do: Set a boundary of how much you are willing to be active in during your free time. Block out the time you need for creative stuff first, then fill in as desired. Don’t be afraid to say no. You don’t have to make an excuse to excuse yourself from an activity. Saying no to someone else is like saying yes to yourself. I used these strategies to buckle down and complete the several ebooks. I’ll be using them to also expand some of those books into online courses as well. Your turn Do you have any indicators or strategies for the super talented?

I am meeting more and more black americans traveling to China. You probably heard this while on the street or in a meeting in China and did not know why someone would say the word “nigga” and no one else around you would react. Let me explain: The word you are hearing is 那个 meaning “that”. The pinyin for this word is NA GE, meaning it should be pronounced like NAH-GUH. If you are studying mandarin from a textbook, it would never show up. The common oral pronunciation is where the difference comes in. When hearing spoken Chinese that word NA GE will sound like “NIG GA,” very close to the derogatory word, or the word heard in some songs too. There is more…. Each language has its own filler words and sounds, the ones used to fill gaps in speech and give our brains time to think . In English we use things like “ummm” and “ahhh” or “like” or “so.” In mandarin, one of those words happens to be 那个. So you won’t only hear the word when some says “我要那个” (I want that one). The word will appear while chatting at the water cooler, in meetings, during speeches, on TV shows. What should be done? “First seek to understand, then seek to be understood,”is what Stephen Covey said in his bestselling book. First understand why a person my be saying what they say, then be open to discussing and talking about your reaction to it. I’ve explained the meaning of the word to colleagues and they now have a new understanding of how I could possibly feel when they say the word.

You\u0026rsquo;re at the line of scrimmage; the snap starts your morning. Which are you? A false starter? On time? Knocked on your butt? Two months ago I felt like i had been knocked on my butt every morning. It was cold. My bed was warm. Mornings are hard. Today I wake up, jump out of bed and get going. I feel energized, charged. I am more focused and ready to get from the day. To get there I had to start really simple. The ideas listed below take less than a minute to do. Feel free to add more in the comments. 1. Change your alarm Having an alarm clock next to my bed made it really easy to hit the snooze button. Move your alarm across the room so that you have to actually get out of bed to turn it off. Tip: You might also want to invest in a traditional alarm clock. Using your mobile phone makes it really tempting to check messages, emails and other things that can change your whole morning mood. 2. Breath Deep Focusing on your breath for one minute moves oxygen throughout your body. Using a breathing pattern can help kick your neurotransmitters into high gear. Tony Robbins does this in morning among other high achievers. Give it a try. Tony Robbins pattern: 1-4-2 first inhale, then hold for 4x the first amount of time, then exhale for 2x the first amount of time. 3. Massage your Face Rubbing under and above your eyelids. Massaging your jaw, cheeks and ears can help make you feel more awake before you jump out of bed. 4. Drink Water After a night of sleeping our body is slightly dehydrated. We need to be sure to add water to our system to keep the blood flowing and hydrated. Some sources say drinking 1.5L in the morning is best. I can\u0026rsquo;t do this in one sitting. For this article, I recommend starting with one glass of water. That can be enough to get you going. Tip: I drink a little noni juice in the morning before I eat my breakfast. 5. Eat a light breakfast I used to try to cook a full, belly filling breakfast for myself. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work well for two reasons: 1. Took too much time to prepare. I missed so many times. 2. I felt tired after eating a big breakfast Having a light breakfast is faster and is just enough to get the metabolism moving. Truth: it might take a little more than a minute to do this, but I\u0026rsquo;m putting it in there anyway. 6. Change your Toothpaste There have been several studies around the negative side effects of toothpaste. I know you might be completely committed to that Colgate Total, but give a new brand a try for a month and see if you notice any changes. 7. Do a wall sit A wall sit is a stationary workout for your thighs. After I complete a wall sit my legs feel warm and my body is ready to keep moving. One minute will be easy for those in shape. If it\u0026rsquo;s a challenge, start with less and work your way up. 8. Do a downward dog Probably the first yoga position taught and with good reason! It is fairly easy to do. It gets your upper body activated. And you can start with one minute and see how you feel after 10 days. 9. Write a gratitude journal Take a minute to write a few things that you are grateful for in the morning. This helps get out of your own head and put something down on paper. After a while you will have a full book of gratitude that you can look to for inspiration and motivation. I highly recommend that solopreneurs do something like this. The solo business world can be overwhelming and depressing at time. It is good to inject habits that help drive inspiration and motivation. 10. Go for a walk This is another activity that might take more than a minute to complete. Going for a walk is a low impact physical exercise. You can even combine this habit with some of the others actions in this list. Use the power of \u0026ldquo;Habit Stacking\u0026rdquo; as SJ Scott would call it to build a routine during your walk. The power of morning routines is evident. There are tons of cases showing that a structured morning can build momentum for the rest of the day. That is why I am taking on the challenge of creating a new program focused on just that.\nYour Turn What would you add to this list? leave a message.

Tony Robbins pattern: 1-4-2 first inhale, then hold for 4x the first amount of time, then exhale for 2x the first amount of time. \u003cstrong\u003e3. Massage your Face\u003c/strong\u003e Rubbing under and above your eyelids. Massaging your jaw, cheeks and ears can help make you feel more awake before you jump out of bed. \u003cstrong\u003e4. Drink Water\u003c/strong\u003e After a night of sleeping our body is slightly dehydrated. We need to be sure to add water to our system to keep the blood flowing and hydrated. Some sources say drinking 1.5L in the morning is best. I can\u0026rsquo;t do this in one sitting. For this article, I recommend starting with one glass of water. That can be enough to get you going. Tip: I drink a little noni juice in the morning before I eat my breakfast. \u003cstrong\u003e5. Eat a light breakfast\u003c/strong\u003e I used to try to cook a full, belly filling breakfast for myself. That didn\u0026rsquo;t work well for two reasons:\n1. Took too much time to prepare. I missed so many times.\n2. I felt tired after eating a big breakfast\nHaving a light breakfast is faster and is just enough to get the metabolism moving. \u003cem\u003eTruth:\u003c/em\u003e it might take a little more than a minute to do this, but I\u0026rsquo;m putting it in there anyway. \u003cstrong\u003e6. Change your Toothpaste\u003c/strong\u003e There have been several studies around the negative side effects of toothpaste. I know you might be completely committed to that Colgate Total, but give a new brand a try for a month and see if you notice any changes. \u003cstrong\u003e7. Do a wall sit\u003c/strong\u003e A wall sit is a stationary workout for your thighs. After I complete a wall sit my legs feel warm and my body is ready to keep moving. One minute will be easy for those in shape. If it\u0026rsquo;s a challenge, start with less and work your way up. \u003cstrong\u003e8. Do a downward dog\u003c/strong\u003e Probably the first yoga position taught and with good reason! It is fairly easy to do. It gets your upper body activated. And you can start with one minute and see how you feel after 10 days. \u003cstrong\u003e9. Write a gratitude journal\u003c/strong\u003e Take a minute to write a few things that you are grateful for in the morning. This helps get out of your own head and put something down on paper. After a while you will have a full book of gratitude that you can look to for inspiration and motivation. I highly recommend that solopreneurs do something like this. The solo business world can be overwhelming and depressing at time. It is good to inject habits that help drive inspiration and motivation. \u003cstrong\u003e10. Go for a walk\u003c/strong\u003e This is another activity that might take more than a minute to complete. Going for a walk is a low impact physical exercise. You can even combine this habit with some of the others actions in this list. Use the power of \u0026ldquo;Habit Stacking\u0026rdquo; as SJ Scott would call it to build a routine during your walk. The power of morning routines is evident. There are tons of cases showing that a structured morning can build momentum for the rest of the day. That is why I am taking on the challenge of creating a new program focused on just that.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"10 super small changes you can make to supercharge your morning."},{"content":" “The most important kind of freedom is to be what you really are.

Liang Everyone’s method for life tuning may be a little different. Some can sit in a catatonic pose for hours. Others need to climb a red oak. One thing is clear, you won’t find your method without acting. In this post I offer some info on one method I personally enjoy: Tai Chi. What is Tai Chi? Tai Chi, with many alternative spellings [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi], is an internal chinese martial art practiced by millions worldwide. Most practitioners use its method for stress relief, rejuvenation and overall physical health. A small select study the self-defense applications hidden within each posture. It’s movements are graceful and studies have shown that there are numerous health benefits. Why Tai Chi? I enjoy Tai Chi because it challenges me to be present while in controlled movement. Not too fast, not still. For those that want to practice meditation and can’t seem to sit still, try tai chi. You might find that it provides a good balance of movement and inward focus. It is also a low impact exercise. This means that even after two knee surgeries and a chronic shoulder injury I can still participate in the fun. Move over cross-fit! Don’t take my word for it. Do a google search and you find that others are writing about how Taich helps:\nDecrease stress Increase aerobic capacity Increase energy Increase balance and agility Increase muscle strength Enhance quality of sleep Enhance immune function Lower cholesterol Improve joint pain Just to name a few things What should I do to get started? Okay, now for the three steps to prepare yourself. 1. Physical readiness. The first few weeks of practice will feel strenuous on your legs. Continuously holding the thighs in flexion is something few people do often. Even if you play high impact sports, this can still be challenging. Try this: Practice a few wall sits a week before starting your practice for 2-5 minutes each day. This can help prepare your legs for the exercise. 2. Mental Readiness. Slowing down can be a challenge. It is so awesome when you get the hang of it. Your mind will be trying to process many things at one time when you begin. Relax and let things be. You will mess up some postures. You will forget what goes next, which foot goes where. It’s okay. Also, don’t forget to breathe. It helps. _Try this: _The traditional method is to have you stand in a “stand like a tree” posture for the first few months. The reason for this is to get your mind and breathe ready before you move. Many schools skip this part in order to appease are need to get moving. Try holding this pose for 10-30 minutes three times a week when you get started. 3. Don’t worry so much about style. It will be easy to get caught in the history and competition of family styles. I recommend letting stay where it is (in the past). The core principles of tai chi stay the same through the family. For your reference, the major family styles are Chen, Yang, Wu and Sun. There are several sub-sects and variations. Too much to get into in this post. Trust me. Try this: Learn the core principles and go try classes from a few different styles.

Below I want to share a few ideas that could save you money and buy you tons of emotional creds.\nLove Languages Before you do or create anything for valentine\u0026rsquo;s day, remember to reflect and think in terms of your lover\u0026rsquo;s love language. How does he or she like to be loved. It is easy to think about what you would want as a romantic gesture. It may not be the same for your partner. Don\u0026rsquo;t know what the love languages are? Here is a quick overview: Everyone has a preference of how they like to give and receive love. It is our job to learn our partners love language and fill their \u0026ldquo;love tank\u0026rdquo; as Gary Chapman says. Those love preferences normally fall into one or two of five categories. Physical Touch. Not just sex. Physical touch and presence is more than hooking up. It is about being, in proximity to the person. Quality Time. Not just being in the same room or doing an activity together. This one is about being fully present with your partner to have some time to talk and share yourselves. Turn off those app notifications for a while. Gift Giving. Quantity does not equal quality. This preference likes to receive tokens of affection. Acts of Kindness. Doing something for your partner that helps them out is a way to show you love them. Words of Appreciation. What you say and how you say it can matter. Say what you feel and share how much you love your partner.\nIdeas to Supercharge Give Memories. Create a picturebook that highlight the moments you and your lover shared together. (gift giving, quality time) Write Rhymes. Poetry can move emotions like no other. Take some time and make the most romantic haiku or sonnet you can. (words of appreciation, gift giving, act of kindness) Donate Time. Work is busy and spending some deep quality time together at home. Enjoy that netflix collection you already paid for and watch Love Actually. lol (quality time, acts of kindness) Compose a Song. If you have an iPad, chances are you also have garageband. Put that music making machine to work and create something sexy and sweet. (words of appreciation, gift giving, act of kindness) Do a dance. It might be a little embarrassing, but a little dance can go a long way. (physical touch, quality time)\nYour Turn What would you add to the list?

Heart rate increase to levels that almost make you want to pass out. The nervous system is saying do everything and anything. Forward. This tendency is to go head first into a fearful situation. Often mistaken as a courageous move, this reaction is really an evasive maneuver. The hope is that by moving forward the range will pass on by. In the workplace this person appears unafraid to take on anyone. And many times this works. Colleagues never expect a head on collision and don\u0026rsquo;t know how to react. Flight.

This reaction is often described as the cowardly move. However, it is no different than going headfirst. It’s all about evasion in hopes of that the danger will go way. Observer. Like a storm chaser getting close to the twister. One has to be calm, relaxed, ready to move as necessary. Typically this form of reaction is trained and practiced. An observer understands that the biological side of fear and can thereby take a step back. They can watch and learn. They can make an assessment and decide what to do.

I read this advice in many books and on many blogs. It serves as an example of using elimination as a method to build a habit of focus. Eliminating the distracting triggers of email itself can leave space for focusing on something, on one thing. 2. Jam Sessions and Pomodoros. The guys over at tropicalmba.com often do jam sessions to focus on doing one thing for a specific period of time. They have a setup [trigger], the session [action] and report an outcome [reward].\nJam Session = stated target to friend -\u0026gt; 50 minutes of focused work -\u0026gt; Reporting when time is up. The reward is in the feedback here. The pomodoro technique has gained popularity the last two years. It was featured in a harvard business review article against franklin covey and the getting things done system (GTD). Pomodoro= make an inventory of stuff to do -\u0026gt; select one -\u0026gt; set timer for 25 minutes -\u0026gt; focus on work until the timer stops -\u0026gt; break for 5 minutes -\u0026gt; go again until the task is done. Every four rounds, take a longer break. About 30 minutes. 3. Breathing to 9. I became aware of this method from a ninjitsu instructor. There are a lot of sources that say breathing is the root of meditation. However, no one else really gave me an exercise like this before to focus on only on my breathe - one thing! How to do it = Get in your position, which ever you choose. it could be a full lots, taking a knee or sitting on the toilet. Doesn’t matter. What matters is that you get totally focused on your breathing. As you breathe, count each breath. When you get to 9, start over at 1. See how many rounds you can do this without drifting off. When I first practiced this exercise I got to 28 once without realizing it. There is no judgement. just practice and keep doing it. Those are three ideas for helping you get focused like a ninja.\nYour Turn What do you do to practice getting focused?

If you struggle with focusing on one thing at a time, I’d like to share a few ideas on how to build a habit of focus [below] I have found that I can be more productive, creative, and inspiring when I am present and focused on one thing at a time. However, my creativity decreases when I am interrupted. I get irritated. My presence gets anchored on something or someone else. I\u0026rsquo;m partially focused. I\u0026rsquo;m waiting for this girl from eharmony to respond to my message. focus lost. There is a power when we focus on one thing. Think of the man in rage. He is focused on doing one thing - destroying his target.On the other side think of the running back that will get to the goal line no matter what. He becomes the hero from his focus.One more example is the fund raiser who is focused on making a mission trip or a volunteer project happen. This person will find anyway and any method to make it happen. Focused. Having focus is a nice ideal. But there’s a catch. Shift happens all around us. How do we stay focused with all the changing demands and distractions? I think the answer lies in habit. Creating a habit of staying focused for a specific period of time can work wonders.

Read on.\nThe search for passion will lead to your demise If you\u0026rsquo;re asking yourself, \u0026ldquo;am I passionate about this?\u0026rdquo; then the answer is already no. You can stop pondering. I spent years pondering what my passion was. I wanted to find the perfect sync between my passion and God\u0026rsquo;s purpose for my life. This pondering led to a long list of things that I felt I could be passionate about and wanted to capitalize on. How do you prioritize a list of your own passions?

It\u0026rsquo;s a good exercise for envisioning a worthy ideal to pursue. The problem with mission building is the gap that it creates between what currently is and what could be. In a charismatic speech, this is good. For a leader, it is necessary. For getting you moving, it\u0026rsquo;s a good start, but it neglects the hard part.

In the winter my morning routine involves rolling over, glancing at my iPhone and hitting the snooze button. It is soooo cold in Shanghai. Each morning I struggle with emerging from the warmth of my bed into a cold room and bathroom. I’ve had routines in the past. They involved trying to do tai chi, qi gong (chi kung), reading books, listening to inspirational stories. I’ve tried a lot of things. Most of my successful morning streaks have taken place in the summer. The winter is hard for me. I’ll admit it. This year I wanted to change that. I decided that one thing I will focus on this month would be holding a morning routine. In this post I want to share how I prepared and what I do. Before that, I will tell you why I am sharing. As of today I have stuck with the routine strong and the benefits are noticeable. I feel more relaxed when I get to work. I have more energy when I go have my breakfast. I am clear about what I want to accomplish that day. I feel happier. I’ve been able to enjoy a morning tea with my roommate. Morning routines have their benefits. Before I started doing this routine. I can say that I was waking up each morning with inconsistent feelings and moods. The gloomy, cloudy days were super depressing. I felt more moments of stress during the day I wasn’t focusing on the right things at work. Everything felt random and scattered. I would skip breakfast My energy levels were not as high until after lunch. I felt stagnate. I’m glad I made the change. I hope by sharing what I did you might also be inspired to make a shift as well.\nHere is what I did Phase I - Awareness of current habit. Before the new year I basically started becoming aware of what I was doing in the morning. Which was not much. I paid attention to myself on work morning and on weekend morning. My weekends were a little more fruitful because they involved having a good breakfast and doing things that I wanted to do. Work days are my area of challenge. Coldness is another area of challenge. I hate the cold weather. Phase II - Do a little research. I took a couple hours and started researching what some successful people do for their morning routines. I looked at Tim Ferris, Tony Robbins, and Steve Jobs. I read Gary Keller’s book, The One thing. Then I started to put my thoughts together. Phase III - Decide what will you do. Make a decision of what you will do. Trying is what didn’t work. I had to set my mind in such a way that I would just do it and stick too it and see what happens. I didn’t set a goal for the whole year. I didn’t set a new year’s resolution. After doing all the research I decide I would do the following routine 1. Jump out of bed immediately and go for a walk in the cold shanghai air. Yes, I decided to take the cold head on. I would walk for 10-15 minutes around the changsha road and change road block. It was easy. I didn’t have to cross the street. Just one block would take about 15 minutes to complete. 2. While walking follow a breathing pattern that Tony Robbins shared. Inhale 4 times in through the nose. Exhale 4 times out through the mouth. 30 cycles for one set. 3. In between sets, Give thanks and gratitude. Give thanks for three things about yourself. Thanks for three things about things around you. Thanks for three things about people around you. Thanks for three moments in life that made you the extraordinary person you are today. Thanks for the vision of my life purpose as it is already happening. Thank God for being here and now, for living in you and through you as you carry out this life purpose. 4. Ask a question for today. “What is one thing I want to focus on being or doing today?” What is in line with my one thing? 5. Return home and heat up some oatmeal. 6. While the oatmeal heats, do a plank or shoulder exercise. 7. Eat 8. Go do that one thing. Phase IV - Do short term testing and retuning. Make a small change. On December 31 at 8:00 PM I was feeling feverish and asked myself, “What can I do tomorrow morning that would help me get ready for making a productive day.” I only committed to doing it for one day. If it didn’t work, I could change. After one day, I committed to doing it for a complete 10 days. Today is the 10th day. I like how I am feeling. I think I will commit to doing it for 10 more days. Keep tuning until you have a habit in place. I will continue reviewing and tuning the routine until I have a habit in place. Could take up to 100 days. I’m not worried about that. I’m just taking it 10 days at a time. That works for me.\nYour turn What morning routine works for you?

Some dread it. Performance goals I get a lot of questions inside and outside of the office about performance goals, especially this time of year. If you are working in an organization it is very likely that you will have some kind of annual performance review and goal setting ritual in place. Almost every business has a system in place to answer two questions. 1. What is expected to happen this year? 2. How will I know we are making good progress against that expectation? Simple right? If so many groups use this method to set targets for the year, why are the surveys and research always saying how ineffective it is?If the research says it is ineffective, why do we continue to do it? No matter how we feel about goals. We probably still need to go through the process. With that said I’d like to share a few ideas for making your performance goal setting task a little bit easier. disclaimer: these ideas and thoughts are entirely my own and do not reflect any opinions from the organizations that I am associated with. 1. Watch a video on smart goal setting. It’s a good reminder of the key components we need to fill in as we write a goal statement. I don’t want to spend a lot of time going through the definition of each letter (Specific, Measurable, Achieveable/Agreed, Measurable, Timebound). There are plenty of resources online that you can find by typing “SMART Goal” into google. 2. Build on your review from last year. I’ve made the mistake of not using my manager’s comments and suggestions from my past year review. This was a good learning for me. The comments and feedback from a past review can be a good setup for setting performance goals in this year. 3. Don’t try to write them all at once. Some goals require a bit a thinking and creativity to get right. Give yourself a few rounds to imagine the criteria and criterion for which you will measure yourself during the year. 4. Think behaviors. Rather than making a done/not done task, consider writing goals that will require consistency over a long period of time. What are some things you can do on a regular basis that impact a larger outcome during the year? What are the drivers? I see a lot of goals that are only revenue targets. For me, it’s hard to imagine waking up in the morning thinking about how I am going to make more money for someone else. I’d rather be challenged to do some behavior that I know I can control. I can think about how to make it more efficient or improve the quality. 5. Productivity vs Efficiency. These two terms are very similar in concept, but approach their output in different ways. Productivity can be defined by the amount of work within a specific time frame.Example: making more phone calls in one hour. Another example: drinking more cups of tea before you have to go to the bathroom. Efficiency can be defined by speed, accuracy and consistent quality within which an employee works. Example: Can you make a single pot of tea with fewer mistakes than before? Can you save more leaves and get the same great taste out of it? In the working world it might look like writing a report with fewer mistakes and still getting it out on time. It could also be achieving the same sales target and spending less on marketing. 6. Balance long, mid, and short range goals and focus. Ideally you would only want to do one big thing at a time. Most books recommend 3-5 goals at one time. This doesn’t mean you have 3 goals that must be achieved by December 31, 2015. You might have a performance behavior that only needs 90 days to become automated. So you focus for those 90 days and make it amazing. Then it becomes automatic and you move on to the next thing. As a training manager I am often challenged by having a million different request for initiatives coming in. I only have two hands. I can only give attention to setting up one thing at a time. At one point, I desperately tried to make it all work at the same time. I made a portfolio of all the projects being requested with a status indicator and next actions defined. I figured if I could get a little bit done on each one then I would be in a good position of making them all happen at the same time. The reality was that I was making mediocre progress on everything and nothing was getting done. It would have been better to do one thing really well and then find a way to have the process automated. After automated and working like a machine, we move on to the next thing. 7. Create development plans that don’t collect dust. My manager used to list out the training courses I should take to support my development areas. Later I would learn that the budget was cut and I wouldn’t be able to do all the training we listed out. I had to get creative. Development plans are about development, not training. Formal training is probably about 10% of what can support development. Start by identifying your areas of focus. This can be making a strength even stronger or filling a weakness gap. Don’t forget about your strengths! Our strengths are what make us stand out and push us to new levels of achievement. Think about things you are already doing during the day that can be converted into learning challenge. You might be writing proposals for customers. How can your proposal writing be taken to the next level? Is it by writing proposal for bigger revenue customers? Is it by leading a team to write proposals without you touching the actual document? Maybe it is training someone else to make their proposals even better? I don’t know. You’ll have to get creative. Build an opportunity portfolio and find out which ones can be focused on this year.Identify steps you want to take to make these things happen.Agree with your company leader that their is opportunity and support to make things happen. Then go do it. 8. Find an informal location to discuss all this. Working in an corporate cube or fishbowl office is not the most creative space. Get outside. Drink some tea. Go for a walk. Anything informal will do.\nYour Turn? Put your email below and I’ll send you a special note every two weeks with some goodies.

What matters most is getting off. You cannot make progress without making decisions.\u0026rdquo;~Jim Rohn How many habits would you like to change in 2015? How many goals have you set in areas of finances, lifestyle, relationships, physical, mental, spiritual, family and career? how much would be on your list? For many us, we have more than 10 things listed down in the inventory of changes to make. And they all need to be worked on right now! I’ve had several people come to me and say they aren’t sure where to begin. They are paralyzed by all the things that they want to change in their life. They want to travel more, say no more often, find the love of their life, eat less junk food, try to learn to dance, practice more yoga, call family more often, and so on…. BUT the paralysis of wanting to do it all now is overwhelming. Consequently, this doesn’t help anything at all. Below you\u0026rsquo;ll find 3 strategies for making a decision so you can get going. I like to think of it as a staircase. You could try to jump up the whole staircase at once. And you would probably fall flat on your face. I wouldn’t laugh at you (really!). The safest way to get to the top of the staircase is to take one step at a time. Stepping up one after another will eventually get you to the top. “But that takes too long!” you may be thinking to yourself. If your somewhat athletic you may try jumping two steps at a time to get to the top even faster. The more momentum you build, the more steps you can conquer at one time. Even with momentum and long legs, getting over 5 or 6 steps is really challenging. Going too fast may lead you tumbling down back to the beginning. At the very least you know that you will start with one. It’s a start. Then, How do you decide what the first should be? 1. You could be super analytical like I am and make a decision matrix. Put your options on one axis. List out your deciding criteria on the other and give it a weight. Ease to implement, Affordability, Proximity to home, related to something I’m doing at work. These are some rough examples. After you have your criteria, give each item a score from 1-10 and let the highest scoring item go first. example: Decision_Matrix.xls (excel file) [ download no longer available] contact me for a copy 2. You could ask the focusing question like Gary Keller does. “What is the one thing should do first that by doing it would make everything else easier?\u0026quot; example: \u0026ldquo;paying down my debt will make it easier to buy those tap dancing shoes I need\u0026rdquo; another example: “cutting my spending on Cheetos will give me some extra money to pay down my debt. I’ll work on the junk food first.\u0026quot; 3. You could leave it to fate. Roll a dice. list out your options, close your eyes and randomly drop your finger on one. Ultimately, deciding one will be enough to get going. Trying to do them all at once leads to exhaustion. Any other ways that you can think of? Share your strategy in the comments. Bonus: I’ll add two more ideas since my brain juice is flowing. I drank some rooibos tea today. 4. Ask 3 friends to vote for their top three choices. Choose the top choice. 5. Go alphabetical.

The safest way to get to the top of the staircase is to take one step at a time. Stepping up one after another will eventually get you to the top. “But that takes too long!” you may be thinking to yourself. If your somewhat athletic you may try jumping two steps at a time to get to the top even faster. The more momentum you build, the more steps you can conquer at one time. Even with momentum and long legs, getting over 5 or 6 steps is really challenging. Going too fast may lead you tumbling down back to the beginning. At the very least you know that you will start with one. It’s a start. Then, How do you decide what the first should be? \u003cstrong\u003e1. You could be super analytical like I am and make a decision matrix.\u003c/strong\u003e Put your options on one axis. List out your deciding criteria on the other and give it a weight. Ease to implement, Affordability, Proximity to home, related to something I’m doing at work. These are some rough examples. After you have your criteria, give each item a score from 1-10 and let the highest scoring item go first. example: Decision_Matrix.xls (excel file) [ download no longer available] \u003ca href=\"https://parisalaw.com/contact/\"\u003econtact me\u003c/a\u003e for a copy \u003cstrong\u003e2. You could ask the focusing question like Gary Keller does.\u003c/strong\u003e\n“What is the one thing should do first that by doing it would make everything else easier?\u0026quot;\n\u003cem\u003eexample:\u003c/em\u003e \u0026ldquo;paying down my debt will make it easier to buy those tap dancing shoes I need\u0026rdquo; \u003cem\u003eanother example:\u003c/em\u003e “cutting my spending on Cheetos will give me some extra money to pay down my debt. I’ll work on the junk food first.\u0026quot; \u003cstrong\u003e3. You could leave it to fate.\u003c/strong\u003e Roll a dice. list out your options, close your eyes and randomly drop your finger on one. Ultimately, deciding one will be enough to get going. Trying to do them all at once leads to exhaustion. Any other ways that you can think of? Share your strategy in the comments. \u003cstrong\u003eBonus:\u003c/strong\u003e I’ll add two more ideas since my brain juice is flowing. I drank some rooibos tea today. \u003cstrong\u003e4.

We make resolutions because we know it would be better for us to lose weight, or get fit, or spend more time with our children. The problem is that a resolution is generally easier to break than it is to keep.” ~ Peter Singer The new year brings new optimism. Although I’m not a fan of new year’s resolutions that you are only going to let fade away before valentine’s day, I do appreciate the honest reflection. I appreciate resolution\u0026rsquo;s as a method of self awareness, saying what we would like to change. Fun fact: only 15 percent of people actually follow thru with their resolutions. Change happens gradually, in small increments. There is no blue pill, or body tapping pattern magic - you have to do the work. If you are truly committed to gradual change, I can almost guarantee you will change your tune and your habits completely over time. 2015 is going to be an extraordinary year. I can feel it. Below I offer some ideas for making your resolutions truly stickk(I meant to write it that way). 1. Be ready to go all in. Remember the Adidas commitment? Or the newly branded Golin? They are going all in. These brands did more than just say they are going all in. Resolutions typically fail because they are never written down. If you write them down, start taking a few actions during holiday, and then return to work and find that there are 5 other things ready to distract you from your newly created resolve. So what happens? You let them gradually fade away or quit for something “more important.” What if you had to pay half a month’s salary if you smoked one cigarette again? Would you stick to with the plan? Of course you would, be cause there is a very big reason to stay fully committed. Find a smart way to go all in and you’ll find a new level of commitment. How to do it. I recommend getting an accountability partner or coach that can actually witness if you follow through or not. On top of that, I would go on over to Stickk and put your money where your mouth is. Stickk was developed to add some monetary pressure to your quest for change. 2. Focus on changing one small piece at a time. Resolutions are usually BIG and vague. “I want to lose weight.” “I’m going to be nice to the people at work.” “ I’m going to finally travel around the world.” After a while the next big thing will take over and grab your attention. Sometimes these also look like goals that are broken down into deadlines and actions for each week. What happens if you miss a deadline? You beat yourself up for not being committed enough. You feel guilty because that oreo cookie was looking so appealing. How to do it. This is just one idea - focus on creating one habit that will support the resolution. Remember that change is gradual. You can start with one habit and really focus on making that one count. After that habit forms, you then define another one. If you make the habits really small, it is possible to create one new habit each month. Really micro habits might even be created in a weak. Gary Keller wrote, \u0026ldquo;it takes an average of 66 days to form a new habit\u0026rdquo;, not 21. It only takes 5 experiences to establish the pattern. However, depending on the complexity, it can take more time to establish as a habit. 3. Work in weekly bursts. Most people try to set a target for the whole year. A whole year is a long time. Enough time to lose motivation. Enough time to forget. Enough time for life to happen. If you focus on making your new change work one week at a time, you can evaluate what worked, what were your barriers, and how you can adapt for the next week. Be agile. How to do it. Don\u0026rsquo;t spend endless hours putting together a spreadsheet to track your progress throughout the year. All those formulas and trend lines won\u0026rsquo;t matter when you keep it simple. Go for one week, day by day, completing your new habit. 4. Grab a buddy or a group. I already mentioned this in the first idea, but I’ll reiterate again. Have someone that can keep you accountable for the change. If you can, find a group that is working together to make the change. You can fill each other with inspiration to keep going on. There are tons of resources online for finding people who are trying to make a similar change. Google is a great first start. Meetup.com can help you find groups of similar interests. or do a search on 43things.com for people with the same goals. 5. Visualize your reasons for making the change. Add this to your daily morning ritual. See yourself living and being the new you. What will it feel like? Will there be a chance in your appearance? Will there be a chance in your environment? What will people around you be saying? 6. Be curious and enjoy the journey. Ultimately this is an exercise in becoming more self-aware of who you are becoming. Many may see their resolutions as a black or white thing. They did it or did not. I offer that you see it as an experience, a journey to learn from. This will be a discovery in knowing what works for you, what doesn’t, and what brick walls will get in your way. If something comes along and shift you away from this resolution, it must have been an amazing thing. That’s a story worth capturing and sharing later. This is not about good or bad, success or failure - it’s all about self tuning. Enjoy it. 7. Drink some tea. I guess I am a little biased because I like tea. Even more than drinking tea, I like that it is a healthy way to force yourself to sit down and reflect on the week or get ready for the day ahead. 2015 is going to be extraordinary.\nYour turn Are there any words of advice or resources you want to share that help you stick to your resolutions.

[newsletter_signup_form id=0] On to the introductions: I’ve met the first five people in person and they have had an impact on my thinking Lee Egbert@milemarker111 http://www.dashfirebitters.com/ img credit http://heavytable.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/dashfire-lee-egbert-325.jpg Lee has a passion for whisky. A couple years ago he started making his own Whisky bitters. Today, Dashfire bitters ship all over the world. How was Lee able to get all this going? For as long as I have known Lee he has aways had an entrepreneurial mind. I remember when he lived in China - he was always finding new opportunities for product creation. At some point he picked up a copy of Tim Ferriss’ 4 hour work week and followed it to the T. He is in tune with his purpose and passion. This guy has found his fire:\nFred Cook -@fredcook - Golin CEO and author of Improvise img credit http://www.instituteforpr.org/wp-content/uploads/Fred-Cook.jpg I never guessed that Fred was the Global CEO of GOLIN. I thought I was just attending another team monthly meeting. Fred came up to me, introduced himself and we talked about how work was going and where he had been traveling to recently. Later when, the office MD announced who he was. WOW! I thought. Such a down to earth guy. Fred continues to impress me year after year. He published “Improvise - unconventional career advice from an unlikely CEO.” That connected the dots for me when I heard more about his career path and journey to be coming CEO. Great stuff!\nJulian Quander -@julianquander - singer, songwriter www.julianquander.com/ img credit https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/shrink_500_500/p/4/000/159/381/17898d9.jpg JQ! Would you believe me if I told you Julian and I grew up across the street from one another? Julian is an amazing musician, songwriter and singer. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know his voice was that good until I wen to one of his shows. We reconnected after almost a decade of not seeing each other. He is doing great things and continues to grow year on year. When it comes to persistence and the pursuit of passion, this guy knows it well. He has given me advice and encouragement countless times. Get to know this guy and show him some love. BTW, he is back in the USA now. Here is one of his music videos:\nDavid Baldwin -@lig360 - Founder of Leadership Insight Group http://www.lig360.com img credit http://www.lig360.com/images/bio_david_baldwin.jpg I had the pleasure of meeting David while he was traveling through Shanghai. He is a relatable guy and knows a lot about leader development. David is certified in a kabillion leadership assessments and inventories. Turns out he holds over a decade of experience as a faculty member at the Center for Creative Leadership. I never knew!\n**Hammurabi Fuentes -@hammurabif - The Core Control Movement ** http://corecontrol.tumblr.com img credit http://corecontrol.tumblr.com/image/89623289405 When i first met Hammurabi, he couldn’t do what you see in the picture. To be honest, I still can’t do what you see in the picture (i\u0026rsquo;m okay with that\u0026hellip;). And that is what makes him an extraordinary person you should follow and get to know. He completely transformed his body and became addicted to everything fitness and nutrition. Shortly after a group of people wanted to work out with him. This became the core control movement. AND if you’re already in shape he has an additional program to get you in even better shape. I put his twitter address above, but I’m not entirely sure if he even tweets anymore. We have internet connection issues here in Shanghai. You can find him down by the docks on weekends. He might be climbing walls, walking slack lines or doing handstands on obscure objects. He is a testament that anyone can get into shape by eating clean and training dirty.\nThe next five people I have not met in person, but have been impacted through their books, programs, etc. I would love to have tea with them and pick their brain one day.\nJosh Kaufman NO\u0026hellip;.Not this Josh Kaufman… just kidding img credit http://s3.amazonaws.com/img.goldderby.com/ck/images/JoshKaufman.jpg I’m talking about this Josh Kaufman -@joshkaufman - Author of the Personal MBA and First 20 Hours - http://www.joshkaufman.net img credit http://media.joshkaufman.net/images/joshkaufman-about.jpg There are a lot of people named Josh Kaufman out there. I wonder if there are many people named Paris Law? Josh started out with a mission of developing an MBA www.personalmba.com curriculum for himself and saving the cost of going to an overpriced school. He called it - the personal MBA. He has now written another book on how to learn anything. Two good works that should be come standard texts for learning and business. His research and development has now expanded into decision making, core human skills and personal science (making yourself better by mini experiments).\nJon Petz -@jonpetz - Author of Boring Meetings Suck http://www.jonpetz.com/ img credit: http://www.nancyvoglspeakers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Petz-Jon.jpg I found out about Jon when I was researching how to make meetings more efficient at work. His work immediately got my attention. It was bold and straightforward - Boring Meetings Suck. When it comes to meeting productivity, this is the guy to know. I love his humor and candor about making the most of meetings. He even has strategies on how to escape them.\nJude Bijou -@judebijou - Author of Attitude Reconstruction http://www.attitudereconstruction.com img credit http://attitudereconstruction.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/JUDE-pix300-270x300.jpg During my research and writing on the attituning process, Jude Bijou’s research and opinions are one the works that I refer back to often. She has created a blueprint for attitude reconstruction that I believe is well done. How do you get to Joy, Love and Peace? Take a look at her work and find out. I’ve read many other books on the topic of attitude and this one is the most practical and methodical that I have found.

I won’t get into all the details here, but you can definitely check it out first and let me know what you think.\nRoy Peter Clark -@roypeterclark - author of How to write short \u0026amp; 50 writing tools www.roypeterclark.com img credit https://acmonteagudo.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/97951.jpg Roy first got my attention when I saw his book “How to Write Short.” It has given me some new strategies for writing in a world of short attention spans. I’ve been so accustomed to academic writing. I want take more steps to improve the tone and style of what I write for the world.I’ll be staying tuned into Roy for some more tips and tricks of the trade. Later I went back to some of my old texts and saw that he also wrote “50 writing tips.” I didn’t get through all 50, but when i saw the name again it was like a lightbulb went off in my mind. It was the same guy. I’m going to be adding a goal for myself to go through the 50 tips this year. One thing at a time thought.\nThere you have it 10 people that you never heard. Don\u0026rsquo;t you want to follow them and learn more? Take action and do it today.\nBONUS: 10 people you’ve probably heard of. However, I think they are worth mentioning in case you haven’t come across them yet. Leo Babauta -@leobabauta www.zenhabits.net The guy who influenced me to take a more minimalist approach in life. He is also creator of the zen habits wordpress theme (the one I\u0026rsquo;m using). I used to collect and keep so many things. For what? I still have a pile of books that I need to deal with. Nevertheless, I’ve significantly reduced the amount of clutter in my home and my mind. Thanks Leo. Benny Lewis -@irishpolyglot www.fluentin3months.com/ Benny continues to approve again and again that you can learn a language in three months. It’s amazing to follow his travels as he continues to learning languages. Be sure to check him out if you are into language learning. Win Wenger -@winwenger - www.winwenger.com/ I’m not sure where Win fits in the timeline with De Bono. He has done some amazing work in the field of creativity. There are so many books written on the subject . His website is outdated, but the content is gold. Josh Waitzkin -@jwaitzkin www.joshwaitzkin.com/ www.theartoflearningproject.org/ Chess Master and Tai Chi Champion. He made a discovery that there was more to it all than just the act of playing chess. He discovered that he had a love of learning that could be applied to any skill. His book is good story on learning toward mastery. Nick Udall -@drnickudall or Nic Turner @nowehere_feed http://www.now-here.com/ These two guys go together. I was introduced to their ideas when I started researching creative thinking methods. They have eight questions that can unlock your world. I should probably write a review post on that. Tina Seelig -@tseelig about.me/tinaseelig I took Tina’s Crash Course on Creativity and recommended it across my company. The innovation engine is a remarkable thought that I play around with often. I’m more interested in the attitudinal portion and how that can be triggered to increase the chances of creative flow. Tim Ferriss -@tferriss http://www.fourhourworkweek.com Mr. Tim Ferriss apparently does everything in 4 hours. Not literally. His books are what I call modern day tools for increasing performance and getting more out of life. He does a lot of research on himself first and then shares what he learnings. Kinda like I do here on this site. Some of his stuff is really cool. I first got interested in Tim Ferriss\u0026rsquo; work through the 4HWW (four hour work week) book and also purchased his other books - 4 hour body \u0026amp; 4 hour chef. **Jason Fried -@jasonfried \u0026amp; David Heinemeier Hansson - @dhh - Authors of Rework **www.basecamp.com The creator of Ruby on Rails and the founder of Basecamp (easiest project management software) wrote a book called, “Rework.” I like the writing style. I also enjoyed how they challenge the norm of business today. Why grow Tony Schwartz -@tonyschwartz www.theenergyproject.com/ Around the time that I was preparing a course on time management I came across Tony’s work. He has researched sports performance psychology and abstracted the concept of energy management in our work. As a creative person and entrepreneur it is important to understand the concepts of energy and when we can really work at our peak states. Also justifies the couch time when we need it. Ramit Sethi -@ramit www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/ Ramit’s tips are helping me work toward being debt free. I like the way he explains things. He has a very straightforward and honest tone. His resources are designed to get you results rather than making you spend a lot of time trying to figure it out. Tell me what you think. Who else is a person that the world should know about? Who should I know about? I’d love to hear their story.\n","permalink":"https://parislaw.net/posts/2015/01/10-people-you-never-heard-of-but-will-want-to-follow-today/","summary":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is a little extra” \u003cstrong\u003e~ Jim Rohn\u003c/strong\u003e\nI read this quote often and ask myself am I doing a little extra here and there.

Created the Personal Empowerment Primer program for those getting started with self improvement and personal development. 4. Successfully launched Cornerstone LMS in the APAC region. Check out the video here. 5. Delivered a session on Project Management for the Microbial Stewardship Conference. 6. Spent 1-month back in the Washington D.C. area, the most in 7 years I’ve been back home. Also visited NYC and Minnesota (where I saw Mr. Dashfire himself) 7. Developed two learning modules related to performance management for IPG 8. Started experimenting with podcasting. Fun! 9. Took a much needed holiday in Bali, Indonesia. Love this place. Hope I can visit the guys from tropicalmba.com next time. 10. Finished NLP Practitioner Certification. Been doing it for a while and never took the time to get certified.\nPosts from 2014 I did not post much on my blog in 2014. Obviously there was a lot going on and the discipline slipped.

In part 1, we explored the idea of a set point and how it is possible to change certain aspects in our pursuit of happiness. In part 2, we looked at the reality of how our conditions impact our happiness. In this post, we’ll look at voluntarily choices (VC) What is a voluntary choice? I want to be clear about our starting definition of voluntary choices before we continue. A voluntary choice is any instance where we are able to demonstrate our will and preference to take or decided not to take action. 40% of our happiness comes from our voluntary choices. This is second to the set point. Therefore, it each choice should be carefully considered when we want to work toward being happy. The Fundamental Option of our choices In every moment where we make a voluntary choice, we are choosing between two fundamental options: toward our own self-development or the opposite direction.

I don’t believe in circumstances. The people who get on in this world are the people who get up and look for the circumstances they want, and if they can’t find them, make them.” ~ George Bernard Shaw This is part 2 of 3 in a series of posts reflecting on the happiness formula. In Part 1, I spoke about the Set Point and challenge the assumption that the set point cannot be changed. This post addresses the second component of happiness: Conditions of Living The latest research tells us that the conditions we live in only account for 10% of our happiness. Surprising? This statistic makes reflect on how two people can grow up under the same circumstances/conditions and have two totally different outcomes. The most skeptical people will attribute one’s success over another to different home environments. What if that were not even the case? What if there was some special something else that determined the difference?\nLet’s Not Ignore Conditions Conditions may be only contribute to 10% of our happiness, but it is still 10 percent that we can work on. George Bernard Shaw got it right in his quote above.\nLet’s Get Real We fear change. The thought of moving to a new place, leaving every thing behind, dealing with a new reality scares us. This fear creates inaction. For most, this is why we don’t change. Instead of doing something about our conditions, we point fingers and blame. The “IF” virus infects: “If only taxes were lower.” “If I made more money.” “If my parents didn’t treat me like that” “If I could just…” Familiar? Finding ourselves in conditions that are not ideal is not difficult. The courage to take action and get out is where we really need to do work. When we find ourselves in a circumstance that is not idea, there are two things that we can do: 1. Be aware of current circumstances and take note Take notice of your conditions. Identify points where small changes could occur. This could be looking at cluttered areas of a home or desk. It could also things like establishing a different response to common requests at work. Your conditions are yours. You will know what is not working for you. 2. Make the circumstance you want Muster up 20-seconds of courage and make one small change today. Don’t do it tomorrow, do it today. Something small. Then do another one tomorrow. I bet by the end of the week you’ll feel different. Bigger changes require more planning. For example, I moved to China in order to fulfill a childhood dream and gain a new perspective on life. What if I’m still not sure what to do? If you’re still unsure about how to make changes, but feel the desire and need to do something different, contact a coach.

Part of the conversation focused on the happiness formula. This formula has yield new insights and understanding about the contributing factors of happiness. The formula: Happiness = Set Point + Conditions of Living + Voluntary Choices Simple, right? Let’s break it down Set Point (SP) Set Point makes of 50% of our happiness. That’s a huge chunk. Here’s the kicker: it’s biologically set, ingrained in our DNA and buried deep within our unconscious process during the first 3-4 years of our life. After we turn 4 years old there is no turning back. I don’t believe that the set point is not changeable. With the vast amount of human genome and neurobiology research happening, there is probably a way to reshape the set point. At a macro level, awareness becomes the first step in being able to reshape your set point. There is a lot to be said about how to become more aware of self and be ready for change. Ways I like to practice self awareness: Schedule time for reflection. I get my notebook and pen ready to look back on the goals I set for the year and review what has happened so far. Prayer. This has been a powerful way for me to set the ego and logical mind aside and let God speak to my heart Qigong (气功). I’ve been practicing qigong for a over 10 years now. I wish I was more consistent with the practice. If you are interested in setting a good foundation in qigong, I recommend you find John Cole and attend one of his workshops. Ask others what they perceive. We’ve all done 360 feedback at work. What about 360 feedback for life? Simple activity.
