Or have you settled into the safe and steady zone? I read articles from startup ventures and entrepreneurs that talk about all the learnings that come from failures. Failure is something we rarely talk about. I mean, look at your Facebook feed for a minute. How many of those posts are about failing at something? I see tons of posts of accomplishments and milestones but not much about when someone has failed at something. My guess at why we don’t want to talk about failure 1. an uninvited pity party may emerge 2. feelings of embarrassment may rise 3. we really want to forget about it. The reality We learn most when we fail at something. It becomes part of who are are on the road to success. Others can learn from those failures. It might be time to share a little more about those downturns. You might actually get more support and help when you let people know what is going on. All the business books talking about failing forward. Should we do the same in our life? What if we learned to embrace failure as a positive thing, we learn to fail faster and better. There is a thought? Attituning : Business

He was talking about six reflective questions for those that “got work to do” One keyword that stuck out in my mind the most was STOP. Do you know when to take a break and just stop doing work? Last week I was not able to get the attuning weekly out because I was sick in bed and just couldn’t get everything done. This was a time to probably stop and take a break. I felt guilty. I just battled through food poisoning and the flu, sick in bed and yet I still felt guilt for not being able to get all the work I wanted to do done. Crazy, right? I was feeling anxiety to get my free training series over at https://simplewp.co published and available. I wanted to make sure that I could publish the official course on time. At the same time I fell behind in marketing and was trying to play catch up. Plus a few other client things that needed to get done. In retrospect I should have just taken a pause and rested. There are a few things I’ve reflected on in the past two weeks.

Are you ready?</h2></header><div class=entry-content><p>Have you ever felt like something is coming? Something big? It makes you feel nervous and excited at the same time. You can plan for it, but aren’t really sure what will happen when things play out. That’s the characteristic of a storm. I’m sure you’ve seen the movies. This week I was hit with some food poisoning out of nowhere. The worst timing EVER. I’ve got a new video training series about to launch at simplewp.co, was just about to get on a plane to go to kyoto, and a new semester beginning at a college I’ll be lecturing at. This storm was an unexpected one. Getting through the illness was the easy part. What I’m talking about is seeing the start of of this new training series launch. I feel that it is going to be big. I’ve done a lot of planning in my mind, but I’m not sure how it will play out when everything is said and done. I had someone randomly contact me yesterday about the exact topic I am preparing to release. Funny. Question: What storm do you see on your horizon? I’m going to embrace this storm, try to keep moving forward and hope for the best. What else can we do? I’ll leave you with a few lyrics from Rob V: I see a storm is coming I’m gonna walk right through there’s no right solution nothing left to do I’m gonna dive in to my heart Want the rest? let me know and I’ll ask him.

Since Valentine’s day just past I thought it was worth reflecting on what love is. Here are my sources of wisdom. The Bible: 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 Love is patient,love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. John Mayer: Love is a verb It ain’t a thing It’s not something you own It’s not something you scream When you show me love I don’t need your words Yeah love ain’t a thing Love is a verb Love ain’t a thing Love is a verb Do you have any quotes or passages that help you define love?

It becomes a place for living and creating memories. But what happens when tragedy hits? Earthquake, tornado, fire, or something of that kind? The house is destroyed. It falls and becomes inhabitable.There are two options: Rebuild or Go find a new place. Rebuilding requires clearing out all that old rubble, checking the foundation, then making a plan to build on top of what used to be. Clearing that rubble is not easy. It usually requires help. A lot of effort and time could be spent only to find that the foundation is no longer usable. Was it a waste? It’s easier to just go out and buy a new house, right? What our lives are like houses? We go through tragedy, sometimes earthshaking. Unfortunately it’s not so easy for us to just buy a new place. We’ve got to clear out the rubble from the experience, check the foundation to see if it is still strong and make a plan to build on what used to be. One thing to keep in mind is that all that rubble can take forever to sort through and clear if you are doing it alone. We need help. Have you been trying to clear out some rubble in your life and avoiding asking for help? Something to think about. Let’s take it a bit further. What if your life has multiple houses, each representing a different area of your life? Relationships, Finances, Health, Learning, Career, Family. Hows the foundation? Attituning: Mind

Several friends have told me that this year was a good year for learning how to let go more. So that got me thinking…. what does it actually mean to let go? First thought - I think of Sylvester Stallone holding on to a man in cliffhanger, trying to save his life. The mans glove loosens and he falls to his demise. Is that letting go? Second thought - On an episode of Gotham, Jim Gordon let’s Barbara, his ex-fiancee, while trying to save her from falling out of a window. Only difference is she was originally trying to kill him. She went insane and this time letting go was releasing her from the wrong turn her life had come to be. Third thought - a song written by DeWayne Woods called, Let Go: As soon as I stop worrying, Worrying how the story ends. When I let go and I let God Let God have his way That’s when things start happening When I stopped looking at back then These reflections taught me several things

You can read about the science of habits or the power of habits all you want. It won’t get you there unless you suck it up and simply get started. I’ve heard that it takes 30 days to build a habit. The other day a guy told me it takes 21 days. The truth is that it it’s not about the number of days at all. To initially imprint a habit in your mind you need five unique experiences. This creates a pattern record in your brain. The determining factor of whether you maintain it or not really depends on the context in which you perform and the complexity of the task. So how can you build a habit in the next five days? Strategy: Start super tiny. Step 1. Define a small action that you can start doing each day. It must be easy to repeat. Let me give you a few examples. Take one multivitamin in the morning. Drink a full glass of water as soon as you wake up. Do 10 pushups before going to bed. Step 2. Write it down somewhere you can see it each day. like your bathroom mirror or your wardrobe. Step 3. Create a tracking system for yourself. could be in your phone or on a calendar Step 4. Mark each time you complete the task that day. Go for five in a row. Step 5. After 10 days, review how you feel and see if you should continue, adjust or stop that habit. Make it something super easy that is almost impossible not to complete. Ideally you want to choose an action that is in line with your direction/goal for the year. Simple as that.

I’d like to start this issue off with a post that was published by Seth Godin, Half Measures. It’s really made me think as I review 2015 and start focusing on plans for 2016. Half Measures If you’re hungry, half a meal is better than no meal. But if you need light, half a lightbulb is actually worse than none at all. If you’re hoping for an 8% return on your investment, 4% is a lot better than zero. And half a home run is worse than nothing. We make two common mistakes: Refusing half when it’s a whole lot better than nothing, and, Accepting half when we’d be better off waiting for what we really need. We are at our best when we set our standards before the offer comes, and when we don’t waver in the moment. Think about it: Have you been waiting for something to be fully ready when half is good enough to get going? What have you been accepting half of when you should really say “not yet” until you find what you really need? 2015 Review
