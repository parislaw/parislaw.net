Since Valentine’s day just past I thought it was worth reflecting on what love is. Here are my sources of wisdom. The Bible: 1 Corinthians 13:4-8 Love is patient,love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. John Mayer: Love is a verb It ain’t a thing It’s not something you own It’s not something you scream When you show me love I don’t need your words Yeah love ain’t a thing Love is a verb Love ain’t a thing Love is a verb Do you have any quotes or passages that help you define love?

It becomes a place for living and creating memories. But what happens when tragedy hits? Earthquake, tornado, fire, or something of that kind? The house is destroyed. It falls and becomes inhabitable.There are two options: Rebuild or Go find a new place. Rebuilding requires clearing out all that old rubble, checking the foundation, then making a plan to build on top of what used to be. Clearing that rubble is not easy. It usually requires help. A lot of effort and time could be spent only to find that the foundation is no longer usable. Was it a waste? It’s easier to just go out and buy a new house, right? What our lives are like houses? We go through tragedy, sometimes earthshaking. Unfortunately it’s not so easy for us to just buy a new place. We’ve got to clear out the rubble from the experience, check the foundation to see if it is still strong and make a plan to build on what used to be. One thing to keep in mind is that all that rubble can take forever to sort through and clear if you are doing it alone. We need help. Have you been trying to clear out some rubble in your life and avoiding asking for help? Something to think about. Let’s take it a bit further. What if your life has multiple houses, each representing a different area of your life? Relationships, Finances, Health, Learning, Career, Family. Hows the foundation? Attituning: Mind

Many success gurus have advocated the need to find your one true passion, or calling. But what if you are the type of person that is not destined to have one true calling in your life? What then? You may be categorized as an unfocused shifter, job hopper, scatter brained. People will say you have so much potential “if only” you could settle down and focus on one thing. Well, I’ve got some news. Forget the opinions. Keep doing what you do. Emillie Wapnick presented a ted talk for all of us multipotentialites out there, the people who dive into many different things.

All we actually know is that music can increase dopamine levels. A handful of experts swear by using music to increase their productivity. I was particularly drawn to the idea of using one song.

Without stress we would not be able to stretch ourselves or achieve anything that matters. The idea of living in complete stasis with no disturbances is a myth. We need to contribute to something. We need to do something that matters to us. There are many tools on the market that claim to help you reduce stress. Have you seen the water goggles? I’m not sure what they do. Or what about the massage chair? That will definitely cool you down. The truth is that you don’t need any of these things. All you really need are the God given tools that are built inside you. The best explanation and breakdown for these tools that I have found are in Jude Bijiou’s book, Attitude Reconstruction. It has been an important work in my research on Attuning. I want to give you a quick summary of those tools below. Emotion Emotion is part of what we feel in response to a stimulus outside of us. This tool can propel us forward or it can drag us down. It depends on how we use it. Think of Denzel Washington in Man on Fire. His emotion became a fuel for getting justice. You see this theme constantly in Steven Seagal films. The key point is that emotion needs an outlet. This outlet can come physically or vocally. If it stays bottled up inside, it will destroy you. Thought Thoughts are things. They are the perspective that our conscious mind allows to fill that part of the brain behind our forehead. The interesting thing about humans is that we have the ability to override our instinctive reactions and thoughts. When we feel fear or anxiety there is an option for us to disassociate and evaluate what we want to do about it. That is an awesome thing. As far as I know other animals are not able to do this. Intuition This is one of the trickiest tools. Accessing our intuition is simple, yet not easy. Emotion and thought can cloud our ability to listen to our intuition. Speech The ability speak things into existence is unique to us. “Life and death lie in the power of the tongue. Therefore, speak life!” the Bible tells us. What kind of words are you speaking on a regular basis? Did you know what we say most of the time probably has materialized into our reality? Speaking of lack brings lack. Speaking of abundance brings abundance. Action The last and most physical part of our toolkit is action. What we do with the other four tools is what matters in the end. You could analyze and evaluate internally all you want. The actions you take in the end are what matter most. So do something. More importantly, do something that matters.
