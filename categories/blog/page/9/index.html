There were many highs and some lows. Below I want to take a minute to reflect on 10 great happenings from the year: 1. Published the How to Be Creative ebook. This was my first project to go through the kindle publishing process. 2. Published a second ebook on Positive Thoughts. 3. Created the Personal Empowerment Primer program for those getting started with self improvement and personal development. 4. Successfully launched Cornerstone LMS in the APAC region. Check out the video here. 5. Delivered a session on Project Management for the Microbial Stewardship Conference. 6. Spent 1-month back in the Washington D.C. area, the most in 7 years I’ve been back home. Also visited NYC and Minnesota (where I saw Mr. Dashfire himself) 7. Developed two learning modules related to performance management for IPG 8. Started experimenting with podcasting. Fun! 9. Took a much needed holiday in Bali, Indonesia. Love this place. Hope I can visit the guys from tropicalmba.com next time. 10. Finished NLP Practitioner Certification. Been doing it for a while and never took the time to get certified.

If you are feeling out of tune, Pray. This will give you the space to reset. If you feel there are too many things to do and not enough time, pray. This will help remind you to focus on what’s important. If you feel nervous about something coming up, or you mind is stuck in something happening now, pray. This will make you more present. If you feel things are moving too fast, pray. This will slow you down. If you feel excited and an achievement, pray. We are able to do these things through God’s wisdom and guidance. In all things, give thanks. In all circumstances, pray. Prayer has power. Prayer is an opportunity for us to reconnect with God and get back in resonance with our true purpose. When in tune our worries, doubts, and fears all fizzle away. Then we can get back to doing extraordinary things and having joy while doing them.
