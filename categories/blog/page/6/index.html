Even worse, it doesn’t look like the pattern is getting better in the near future. How do you deal with it?

Have you ever wondered why? Does it even matter why? What would happen if you shifted your perspective from weaknesses to only looking at your strengths? This week I ran a workshop with several leaders on leveraging their strengths rather than looking at their weaknesses. It was a very productive day. We were able to look at an entirely different perspective for the team. Rather than looking at the team as something to be fixed, we began asking questions about how do we evolve and make a bigger impact with what we do well already.

If not, that’s okay. This post will keep it simple and make things clear for you. Knowing the difference between the two can save you a lot of time and effort in your decision-making. You might be working with a mentor and not even know it. You might be paying for a coach and not even need it. I searched the web and discovered many different descriptions, definitions and explanations between coaching and mentoring. There are many overlaps in the skills that coaches and mentors use. The simplest distinction that I have found between the two is experience and advice. Since I’m in China I always wonder what the difference might be in Chinese words as well. I’ve included them in this post.

If you want to live a long life, you need eustress, that is, a deep sense of meaning and of contribution to worthy projects and causes, particularly, your intergenerational family.” ~Stephen Covey Not all stress is bad. I used to believe that I wanted to eliminate all stress in my life. I wanted to be stress free and full of glee. Boy was I wrong. Rather than seeking to eliminate stress once and for all, I found that it is much more constructive to acknowledge and appreciate stress for what it is, then make it work in my favor. This post is all about understanding what stress is and how to identify attributes of the two types.
