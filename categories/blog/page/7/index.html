However, the fact that you’re reading already tells you one of two things: 1. You’ve thought about the dark side of being overly talented 2. You have an inkling that this might be true for you or someone you know. What sparked this thought? After several recent conversations with folks about what I am currently doing in terms of business or career, the words “you’re so talented” kept coming up. Not trying to toot my own horn. Keep reading. I just returned from a trip to wudang mountain where I studied the original taiji 13 form, I’m working on a web design project related to chess, I’ve written several ebooks and guides for others, and I even coach others to discover their life purpose and get clear about where they are going. There is a caveat. I don’t believe I am the only one that is able to do many different things generally well. A “practitioner of many and master of none” come to mind. Being able to do many things has benefits when it is time to get something started. However, to really get focused and master one thing is not very easy. Too much talent can lead to a lack of focus. Two Signs that your talent is causing you to be unfocused. Sign 1. Trying out several new things at one time and never completing When you have so many different areas of interest and capability it is really easy to be distracted by one other thing that you would like to try and see if it is for you. I’ve started countless mini websites and lost interest within the first 3 months. How distracted do you get when you are trying to focus on something? If you find yourself starting many different things and not much getting complete, this can be a problem. What to do:

I am meeting more and more black americans traveling to China. You probably heard this while on the street or in a meeting in China and did not know why someone would say the word “nigga” and no one else around you would react. Let me explain: The word you are hearing is 那个 meaning “that”. The pinyin for this word is NA GE, meaning it should be pronounced like NAH-GUH. If you are studying mandarin from a textbook, it would never show up. The common oral pronunciation is where the difference comes in. When hearing spoken Chinese that word NA GE will sound like “NIG GA,” very close to the derogatory word, or the word heard in some songs too. There is more…. Each language has its own filler words and sounds, the ones used to fill gaps in speech and give our brains time to think . In English we use things like “ummm” and “ahhh” or “like” or “so.” In mandarin, one of those words happens to be 那个. So you won’t only hear the word when some says “我要那个” (I want that one). The word will appear while chatting at the water cooler, in meetings, during speeches, on TV shows. What should be done? “First seek to understand, then seek to be understood,”is what Stephen Covey said in his bestselling book. First understand why a person my be saying what they say, then be open to discussing and talking about your reaction to it. I’ve explained the meaning of the word to colleagues and they now have a new understanding of how I could possibly feel when they say the word. This makes a difference as they are more aware of how their words have impact.

I’ve built up a listing of the various options. There are enough choices to confuse anyone. I thought it might be helpful to share what I’ve collected so far. This could be you: A HR/L &amp;D; pro trying to make some of your courses more accessible to staff; a solo business owner looking for a way to share your expertise online {and possibly profit from it}. Udemy is not the only option. It will be helpful to identify the type of platform you want before you dive in. There are three basic types: Fixed Price Subscription - you pay a fee, they give you space and bandwidth based on the price you pay. Good for those with courses that are not memory heavy (text or mp3 only) Pay per user - you pay as participants are actively registered or using your courseware. Good for companies that know how many people will use. Also good for coaches and consultants that register groups in batches. Give a cut - no upfront costs, but you pay a % based on your sales. Good for the bootstrapped that wants to get something going without initial overhead. What do I prefer? I prefer to bootstrap with gumroad or setup a self-hosted wordpress site. It will take a separate post for me to explain how to do each. In the mean time, here is a list for your perusal {no links to keep things even}.

You’re at the line of scrimmage; the snap starts your morning. Which are you? A false starter? On time? Knocked on your butt? Two months ago I felt like i had been knocked on my butt every morning. It was cold. My bed was warm. Mornings are hard. Today I wake up, jump out of bed and get going. I feel energized, charged. I am more focused and ready to get from the day. To get there I had to start really simple. The ideas listed below take less than a minute to do. Feel free to add more in the comments. 1. Change your alarm Having an alarm clock next to my bed made it really easy to hit the snooze button. Move your alarm across the room so that you have to actually get out of bed to turn it off. Tip: You might also want to invest in a traditional alarm clock. Using your mobile phone makes it really tempting to check messages, emails and other things that can change your whole morning mood. 2. Breath Deep Focusing on your breath for one minute moves oxygen throughout your body. Using a breathing pattern can help kick your neurotransmitters into high gear. Tony Robbins does this in morning among other high achievers. Give it a try. Tony Robbins pattern: 1-4-2 first inhale, then hold for 4x the first amount of time, then exhale for 2x the first amount of time. 3. Massage your Face Rubbing under and above your eyelids. Massaging your jaw, cheeks and ears can help make you feel more awake before you jump out of bed. 4. Drink Water After a night of sleeping our body is slightly dehydrated. We need to be sure to add water to our system to keep the blood flowing and hydrated. Some sources say drinking 1.5L in the morning is best. I can’t do this in one sitting. For this article, I recommend starting with one glass of water. That can be enough to get you going. Tip: I drink a little noni juice in the morning before I eat my breakfast. 5. Eat a light breakfast I used to try to cook a full, belly filling breakfast for myself. That didn’t work well for two reasons: 1. Took too much time to prepare. I missed so many times. 2. I felt tired after eating a big breakfast Having a light breakfast is faster and is just enough to get the metabolism moving. Truth: it might take a little more than a minute to do this, but I’m putting it in there anyway. 6. Change your Toothpaste There have been several studies around the negative side effects of toothpaste. I know you might be completely committed to that Colgate Total, but give a new brand a try for a month and see if you notice any changes. 7. Do a wall sit A wall sit is a stationary workout for your thighs. After I complete a wall sit my legs feel warm and my body is ready to keep moving. One minute will be easy for those in shape. If it’s a challenge, start with less and work your way up. 8. Do a downward dog Probably the first yoga position taught and with good reason! It is fairly easy to do. It gets your upper body activated. And you can start with one minute and see how you feel after 10 days. 9. Write a gratitude journal Take a minute to write a few things that you are grateful for in the morning. This helps get out of your own head and put something down on paper. After a while you will have a full book of gratitude that you can look to for inspiration and motivation. I highly recommend that solopreneurs do something like this. The solo business world can be overwhelming and depressing at time. It is good to inject habits that help drive inspiration and motivation. 10. Go for a walk This is another activity that might take more than a minute to complete. Going for a walk is a low impact physical exercise. You can even combine this habit with some of the others actions in this list. Use the power of “Habit Stacking” as SJ Scott would call it to build a routine during your walk. The power of morning routines is evident. There are tons of cases showing that a structured morning can build momentum for the rest of the day. That is why I am taking on the challenge of creating a new program focused on just that.

Until this morning. On my morning walk I passed 8 different people who were taking their dogs for a walk. Then it hit me. Dogs help us add consistency in our lives. Consistency in the morning. Fido will have to go to the bathroom every morning, even if you are hungover. The avoidance of waking up to a puddle on your hard wood floors is motivation enough to get up and get moving. Also, the whining will be hard to ignore. Having a dog is like a living, breathing alarm clock that sets itself. Amazing. Structure My previous dogs knew exactly where to go when we went out. They would occasionally want to explore new areas, but most times the plan is to repeat what is known. The structure in the morning could also be a guideline of how we should get ourselves going in the morning. Getting up immediately. Getting moving. Preparing food and water. Preparing the night before. Habit Lessons Training a dog require consistency and structure in order to make new behaviors stick. Remember trying to paper train a Pomeranian or getting your Rottweiler to walk beside you rather than choke trying to stay ahead. The same method used to train dogs is same way that we create habits. The difference in humans is that we have a judgement center that can override previously established behaviors. Override enough times and a new trigger-behavior is created. A word of caution Now I’m not encouraging you to go out and get a dog as your solution for building a morning routine. That would be the wrong reason to invest time in taking care of another life. Dogs also bring companionship and love to their owners. Be sure that you are ready and have the resources to take on that responsibility. There are too many dogs out there that have been abandoned by our their owners (kinda like those new year resolutions).

Liang Everyone’s method for life tuning may be a little different. Some can sit in a catatonic pose for hours. Others need to climb a red oak. One thing is clear, you won’t find your method without acting. In this post I offer some info on one method I personally enjoy: Tai Chi. What is Tai Chi? Tai Chi, with many alternative spellings [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi], is an internal chinese martial art practiced by millions worldwide. Most practitioners use its method for stress relief, rejuvenation and overall physical health. A small select study the self-defense applications hidden within each posture. It’s movements are graceful and studies have shown that there are numerous health benefits. Why Tai Chi? I enjoy Tai Chi because it challenges me to be present while in controlled movement. Not too fast, not still. For those that want to practice meditation and can’t seem to sit still, try tai chi. You might find that it provides a good balance of movement and inward focus. It is also a low impact exercise. This means that even after two knee surgeries and a chronic shoulder injury I can still participate in the fun. Move over cross-fit! Don’t take my word for it. Do a google search and you find that others are writing about how Taich helps:
