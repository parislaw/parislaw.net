However, the fact that you’re reading already tells you one of two things: 1. You’ve thought about the dark side of being overly talented 2. You have an inkling that this might be true for you or someone you know. What sparked this thought? After several recent conversations with folks about what I am currently doing in terms of business or career, the words “you’re so talented” kept coming up. Not trying to toot my own horn. Keep reading. I just returned from a trip to wudang mountain where I studied the original taiji 13 form, I’m working on a web design project related to chess, I’ve written several ebooks and guides for others, and I even coach others to discover their life purpose and get clear about where they are going. There is a caveat. I don’t believe I am the only one that is able to do many different things generally well. A “practitioner of many and master of none” come to mind. Being able to do many things has benefits when it is time to get something started. However, to really get focused and master one thing is not very easy. Too much talent can lead to a lack of focus. Two Signs that your talent is causing you to be unfocused. Sign 1. Trying out several new things at one time and never completing When you have so many different areas of interest and capability it is really easy to be distracted by one other thing that you would like to try and see if it is for you. I’ve started countless mini websites and lost interest within the first 3 months. How distracted do you get when you are trying to focus on something? If you find yourself starting many different things and not much getting complete, this can be a problem. What to do:

I am meeting more and more black americans traveling to China. You probably heard this while on the street or in a meeting in China and did not know why someone would say the word “nigga” and no one else around you would react. Let me explain: The word you are hearing is 那个 meaning “that”. The pinyin for this word is NA GE, meaning it should be pronounced like NAH-GUH. If you are studying mandarin from a textbook, it would never show up. The common oral pronunciation is where the difference comes in. When hearing spoken Chinese that word NA GE will sound like “NIG GA,” very close to the derogatory word, or the word heard in some songs too. There is more…. Each language has its own filler words and sounds, the ones used to fill gaps in speech and give our brains time to think . In English we use things like “ummm” and “ahhh” or “like” or “so.” In mandarin, one of those words happens to be 那个. So you won’t only hear the word when some says “我要那个” (I want that one). The word will appear while chatting at the water cooler, in meetings, during speeches, on TV shows. What should be done? “First seek to understand, then seek to be understood,”is what Stephen Covey said in his bestselling book. First understand why a person my be saying what they say, then be open to discussing and talking about your reaction to it. I’ve explained the meaning of the word to colleagues and they now have a new understanding of how I could possibly feel when they say the word. This makes a difference as they are more aware of how their words have impact.

I’ve built up a listing of the various options. There are enough choices to confuse anyone. I thought it might be helpful to share what I’ve collected so far. This could be you: A HR/L &amp;D; pro trying to make some of your courses more accessible to staff; a solo business owner looking for a way to share your expertise online {and possibly profit from it}. Udemy is not the only option. It will be helpful to identify the type of platform you want before you dive in. There are three basic types: Fixed Price Subscription - you pay a fee, they give you space and bandwidth based on the price you pay. Good for those with courses that are not memory heavy (text or mp3 only) Pay per user - you pay as participants are actively registered or using your courseware. Good for companies that know how many people will use. Also good for coaches and consultants that register groups in batches. Give a cut - no upfront costs, but you pay a % based on your sales. Good for the bootstrapped that wants to get something going without initial overhead. What do I prefer? I prefer to bootstrap with gumroad or setup a self-hosted wordpress site. It will take a separate post for me to explain how to do each. In the mean time, here is a list for your perusal {no links to keep things even}. Add a comment if you have used one in the past or want to add something. Wordpress Plugin/Add-on
