The thing is: feelings are fleeting. They come and go as they please. We have a feeling of anger, eat some ice cream, then cool down. Gratitude shouldn’t work that way.

I wanted to help facilitate members through the process of planning their content calendar for 2017. As I was developing the materials I realized that there are some steps and questions that must be answered even before you create the calendar. That’s where this post comes in. If you haven’t already completed your content planning for 2017, I have a few resources for you to get started. In this post you will find 5 questions to help you think through the content planning process. After answering these five questions you will have a good foundation for creating your content calendar for 2017. Let’s get to the questions:

When you do a thing, do it with all your might. Put your whole soul into it. Stamp it with your own personality. Be active, be energetic, be enthusiastic and faithful, and you will accomplish your object. Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.” ~Ralph Waldo Emerson Do you feel enthusiastic right now? How about this morning? How about yesterday evening? Enthusiasm is a powerful “Engine” for success according to Emerson. If you’re not utilizing this it might be time to pause and reflect. In this post I want to take a look at Emerson’s quote and extract some actionable steps that can be applied. Wouldn’t it be awesome to tune up your Enthusiasm when you want? Read on

If you’ve been around me the last decade you probably know that I love these two dishes with a passion. I’m on a secret mission to introduce Carrot Cake into the lives of those who never experienced its goodness before. Pancakes are one of my simple pleasures to enjoy with a friend and have discussions about life purpose and philosophy. I like both. Both are sweet. Both are filling. Both are fattening. Truth is I shouldn’t be eating either one. I’ve rationalized that I can enjoy on occasion if I am doing the right work with my diet and exercise. Do you have any simple pleasures? The thing is that these two simple pleasures could be destructive or extremely motivating. It all depends on how I use them. Do you have any pleasures in your life like that? What are they?

Or have you settled into the safe and steady zone? I read articles from startup ventures and entrepreneurs that talk about all the learnings that come from failures. Failure is something we rarely talk about. I mean, look at your Facebook feed for a minute. How many of those posts are about failing at something? I see tons of posts of accomplishments and milestones but not much about when someone has failed at something. My guess at why we don’t want to talk about failure 1. an uninvited pity party may emerge 2. feelings of embarrassment may rise 3. we really want to forget about it. The reality We learn most when we fail at something. It becomes part of who are are on the road to success. Others can learn from those failures. It might be time to share a little more about those downturns. You might actually get more support and help when you let people know what is going on. All the business books talking about failing forward. Should we do the same in our life? What if we learned to embrace failure as a positive thing, we learn to fail faster and better.
