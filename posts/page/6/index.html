If you missed it, go check out part one. My reflection I am structuring the summary the right way, but it doesn’t feel like it is completely there yet in terms of having that solid umph. You know what I mean? Writing that first, mouthwatering, juicy-steak type opening will take some time I think. I will have to eventually just decide on a draft and then evolve it over time. Why write multiple drafts? Writing multiple drafts allows you to articulate your message in different ways. You can play around with a variety of angles and then pick and choose the parts that resonate well with you. Don’t forget to follow along by downloading the presentation and worksheet. They will help get into details. It may help to go back to see my starting point. Here is the latest copy that I am working with: When I was 13, I wrote in my journal that I wanted to go and live in China for an extended period of time. For 8 years I have been living that dream. I’ve been studying human potential and leadership for over 15 years. I have been applying those learnings to empower myself and those around me, in many different shapes and forms. People call me a “creative leader,” “out-of-the-box thinker,” I’ve also been told that I am a good listener who can show empathy without judgement. I have been using my powers of creativity, leadership and tech obsession to work with: _Freelancers & Small Businesses. Still haven’t launched that website yet? Struggling to narrow down your audience? I can help you get clear and get it done. _ _Marketing Directors & Managers. Being “busy” should be a stressful thing. I can help reinvigorate you and your team to be more creative and focused on working together. _ _Frustrated Professionals. Thinking of quitting? Feel like there is more you want to do in your life? I can walk you through a process for sifting through your thinking. _ _Event Organizers, Conference Organizers & Associations. Need a keynote speaker on personal development? I can help rock the stage. _ Download the Working With Paris PDF below or take a look at one of my ebooks to get started. I’m still focusing on pretty much the same clientele. I think that might remain the same throughout. I will need to also test whether or not it is in line with their needs. Yep! more research later. What do you think of the latest draft? Is it getting better or worse?

The secret: leveraging linkedin and applying inbound marketing techniques together. It’s 2015, LinkedIN has gained a stronger presence in China and I want to dive into the art of using this platform again.

Your worries about stress don’t have to do with stress at all. Stress is your body’s response to some change, problem or transition. It is meant to keep you safe from harm or gear up for a task at hand. **So why do I feel so bad when you say “I’m stressed?” **Good Question. Society has painted a picture that stress is something we should be battling against, beating or destroying. This is all wrong. Thankfully we have people like Kelly McGonigal finding research that helps dispel this propaganda. If you have a minute watch her TED talk on making stress your friend. [ted id=1815 lang=zh-cn]

Without stress we would not be able to stretch ourselves or achieve anything that matters. The idea of living in complete stasis with no disturbances is a myth. We need to contribute to something. We need to do something that matters to us. There are many tools on the market that claim to help you reduce stress. Have you seen the water goggles? I’m not sure what they do. Or what about the massage chair? That will definitely cool you down. The truth is that you don’t need any of these things. All you really need are the God given tools that are built inside you. The best explanation and breakdown for these tools that I have found are in Jude Bijiou’s book, Attitude Reconstruction. It has been an important work in my research on Attuning. I want to give you a quick summary of those tools below. Emotion Emotion is part of what we feel in response to a stimulus outside of us. This tool can propel us forward or it can drag us down. It depends on how we use it. Think of Denzel Washington in Man on Fire. His emotion became a fuel for getting justice. You see this theme constantly in Steven Seagal films. The key point is that emotion needs an outlet. This outlet can come physically or vocally. If it stays bottled up inside, it will destroy you. Thought Thoughts are things. They are the perspective that our conscious mind allows to fill that part of the brain behind our forehead. The interesting thing about humans is that we have the ability to override our instinctive reactions and thoughts. When we feel fear or anxiety there is an option for us to disassociate and evaluate what we want to do about it. That is an awesome thing. As far as I know other animals are not able to do this. Intuition This is one of the trickiest tools. Accessing our intuition is simple, yet not easy. Emotion and thought can cloud our ability to listen to our intuition. Speech The ability speak things into existence is unique to us. “Life and death lie in the power of the tongue. Therefore, speak life!” the Bible tells us. What kind of words are you speaking on a regular basis? Did you know what we say most of the time probably has materialized into our reality? Speaking of lack brings lack. Speaking of abundance brings abundance. Action The last and most physical part of our toolkit is action. What we do with the other four tools is what matters in the end. You could analyze and evaluate internally all you want. The actions you take in the end are what matter most. So do something. More importantly, do something that matters.
