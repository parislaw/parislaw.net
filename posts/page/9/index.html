You’re at the line of scrimmage; the snap starts your morning. Which are you? A false starter? On time? Knocked on your butt? Two months ago I felt like i had been knocked on my butt every morning. It was cold. My bed was warm. Mornings are hard. Today I wake up, jump out of bed and get going. I feel energized, charged. I am more focused and ready to get from the day. To get there I had to start really simple. The ideas listed below take less than a minute to do. Feel free to add more in the comments. 1. Change your alarm Having an alarm clock next to my bed made it really easy to hit the snooze button. Move your alarm across the room so that you have to actually get out of bed to turn it off. Tip: You might also want to invest in a traditional alarm clock. Using your mobile phone makes it really tempting to check messages, emails and other things that can change your whole morning mood. 2. Breath Deep Focusing on your breath for one minute moves oxygen throughout your body. Using a breathing pattern can help kick your neurotransmitters into high gear. Tony Robbins does this in morning among other high achievers. Give it a try. Tony Robbins pattern: 1-4-2 first inhale, then hold for 4x the first amount of time, then exhale for 2x the first amount of time. 3. Massage your Face Rubbing under and above your eyelids. Massaging your jaw, cheeks and ears can help make you feel more awake before you jump out of bed. 4. Drink Water After a night of sleeping our body is slightly dehydrated. We need to be sure to add water to our system to keep the blood flowing and hydrated. Some sources say drinking 1.5L in the morning is best. I can’t do this in one sitting. For this article, I recommend starting with one glass of water. That can be enough to get you going. Tip: I drink a little noni juice in the morning before I eat my breakfast. 5. Eat a light breakfast I used to try to cook a full, belly filling breakfast for myself. That didn’t work well for two reasons: 1. Took too much time to prepare. I missed so many times. 2. I felt tired after eating a big breakfast Having a light breakfast is faster and is just enough to get the metabolism moving. Truth: it might take a little more than a minute to do this, but I’m putting it in there anyway. 6. Change your Toothpaste There have been several studies around the negative side effects of toothpaste. I know you might be completely committed to that Colgate Total, but give a new brand a try for a month and see if you notice any changes. 7. Do a wall sit A wall sit is a stationary workout for your thighs. After I complete a wall sit my legs feel warm and my body is ready to keep moving. One minute will be easy for those in shape. If it’s a challenge, start with less and work your way up. 8. Do a downward dog Probably the first yoga position taught and with good reason! It is fairly easy to do. It gets your upper body activated. And you can start with one minute and see how you feel after 10 days. 9. Write a gratitude journal Take a minute to write a few things that you are grateful for in the morning. This helps get out of your own head and put something down on paper. After a while you will have a full book of gratitude that you can look to for inspiration and motivation. I highly recommend that solopreneurs do something like this. The solo business world can be overwhelming and depressing at time. It is good to inject habits that help drive inspiration and motivation. 10. Go for a walk This is another activity that might take more than a minute to complete. Going for a walk is a low impact physical exercise. You can even combine this habit with some of the others actions in this list. Use the power of “Habit Stacking” as SJ Scott would call it to build a routine during your walk. The power of morning routines is evident. There are tons of cases showing that a structured morning can build momentum for the rest of the day. That is why I am taking on the challenge of creating a new program focused on just that.

Until this morning. On my morning walk I passed 8 different people who were taking their dogs for a walk. Then it hit me. Dogs help us add consistency in our lives. Consistency in the morning. Fido will have to go to the bathroom every morning, even if you are hungover. The avoidance of waking up to a puddle on your hard wood floors is motivation enough to get up and get moving. Also, the whining will be hard to ignore. Having a dog is like a living, breathing alarm clock that sets itself. Amazing. Structure My previous dogs knew exactly where to go when we went out. They would occasionally want to explore new areas, but most times the plan is to repeat what is known. The structure in the morning could also be a guideline of how we should get ourselves going in the morning. Getting up immediately. Getting moving. Preparing food and water. Preparing the night before. Habit Lessons Training a dog require consistency and structure in order to make new behaviors stick. Remember trying to paper train a Pomeranian or getting your Rottweiler to walk beside you rather than choke trying to stay ahead. The same method used to train dogs is same way that we create habits. The difference in humans is that we have a judgement center that can override previously established behaviors. Override enough times and a new trigger-behavior is created. A word of caution Now I’m not encouraging you to go out and get a dog as your solution for building a morning routine. That would be the wrong reason to invest time in taking care of another life. Dogs also bring companionship and love to their owners. Be sure that you are ready and have the resources to take on that responsibility. There are too many dogs out there that have been abandoned by our their owners (kinda like those new year resolutions).

Liang Everyone’s method for life tuning may be a little different. Some can sit in a catatonic pose for hours. Others need to climb a red oak. One thing is clear, you won’t find your method without acting. In this post I offer some info on one method I personally enjoy: Tai Chi. What is Tai Chi? Tai Chi, with many alternative spellings [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi], is an internal chinese martial art practiced by millions worldwide. Most practitioners use its method for stress relief, rejuvenation and overall physical health. A small select study the self-defense applications hidden within each posture. It’s movements are graceful and studies have shown that there are numerous health benefits. Why Tai Chi? I enjoy Tai Chi because it challenges me to be present while in controlled movement. Not too fast, not still. For those that want to practice meditation and can’t seem to sit still, try tai chi. You might find that it provides a good balance of movement and inward focus. It is also a low impact exercise. This means that even after two knee surgeries and a chronic shoulder injury I can still participate in the fun. Move over cross-fit! Don’t take my word for it. Do a google search and you find that others are writing about how Taich helps:

If we can acknowledge our fear, we can realize that right now we are okay. Right now, today, we are still alive, and our bodies are working marvelously. Our eyes can still see the beautiful sky. Our ears can still hear the voices of our loved ones.” ~Thich Nhat Hanh Fear is a natural instinct. Fear keeps us away from danger. Fear forces us to evaluate. Fear is a mental reaction. Originally, threats came in the form of a tyrannosaurus rex or velociraptor that wanted to make us the Sunday afternoon meal. Our reaction either made us an easy snack or allowed us to live another day. Today, the same reaction exists. However, the threats are very different. Our fearful reactions come when we get an unexpected email from our boss: “come see me.” Or when a loved one texts you - “we’re done” What does that mean???? Non life threatening reactions have become triggers for fear. In this post I want to describe the four types of reactions that have been described to me. How do you react to fear? I’ve talked to several different people about how they react when fear sets in. From these informal interviews there seem to be four types of reactions to this feeling we all have from one time to another. Freeze. Like a dear in headlights. Muscles tense up. Heart rate increase to levels that almost make you want to pass out. The nervous system is saying do everything and anything. Forward. This tendency is to go head first into a fearful situation. Often mistaken as a courageous move, this reaction is really an evasive maneuver. The hope is that by moving forward the range will pass on by. In the workplace this person appears unafraid to take on anyone. And many times this works. Colleagues never expect a head on collision and don’t know how to react. Flight. The tendency is to go anywhere away from the current situation. The intention is the same as the forward reaction type, but the direction is different. This reaction is often described as the cowardly move. However, it is no different than going headfirst. It’s all about evasion in hopes of that the danger will go way. Observer. Like a storm chaser getting close to the twister. One has to be calm, relaxed, ready to move as necessary. Typically this form of reaction is trained and practiced. An observer understands that the biological side of fear and can thereby take a step back. They can watch and learn. They can make an assessment and decide what to do. I don’t believe that fear is something that we should conquer. I believe it is something that we should be aware of and understand so that it does not become a barrier to doing the extraordinary work that we are meant to do in this life. Someone once told me that the definition of courage is not the absence of fear. Instead, courage is feeling the fear and choosing to act anyway.

Habit stacking is not task shifting. Habit and discipline are not the same. These phrases are tossed around. What they all really mean to say is, “focus on one thing at a time.” As I write this I notice that I have four browser tabs open, one iphone next to me, 10+ people around me chatting. We live in a world of distraction. Let’s face it.So how do we build this super important practice in a modern world? If you struggle with focusing on one thing at a time, I’d like to share a few ideas on how to build a habit of focus [below] I have found that I can be more productive, creative, and inspiring when I am present and focused on one thing at a time. However, my creativity decreases when I am interrupted. I get irritated. My presence gets anchored on something or someone else. I’m partially focused. I’m waiting for this girl from eharmony to respond to my message. focus lost. There is a power when we focus on one thing. Think of the man in rage. He is focused on doing one thing - destroying his target.On the other side think of the running back that will get to the goal line no matter what. He becomes the hero from his focus.One more example is the fund raiser who is focused on making a mission trip or a volunteer project happen. This person will find anyway and any method to make it happen. Focused. Having focus is a nice ideal. But there’s a catch. Shift happens all around us. How do we stay focused with all the changing demands and distractions? I think the answer lies in habit. Creating a habit of staying focused for a specific period of time can work wonders. The requirement for getting there is sustaining discipline long enough to let the habit solidify. 66 days on average.

In the winter my morning routine involves rolling over, glancing at my iPhone and hitting the snooze button. It is soooo cold in Shanghai. Each morning I struggle with emerging from the warmth of my bed into a cold room and bathroom. I’ve had routines in the past. They involved trying to do tai chi, qi gong (chi kung), reading books, listening to inspirational stories. I’ve tried a lot of things. Most of my successful morning streaks have taken place in the summer. The winter is hard for me. I’ll admit it. This year I wanted to change that. I decided that one thing I will focus on this month would be holding a morning routine. In this post I want to share how I prepared and what I do. Before that, I will tell you why I am sharing. As of today I have stuck with the routine strong and the benefits are noticeable. I feel more relaxed when I get to work. I have more energy when I go have my breakfast. I am clear about what I want to accomplish that day. I feel happier. I’ve been able to enjoy a morning tea with my roommate. Morning routines have their benefits. Before I started doing this routine. I can say that I was waking up each morning with inconsistent feelings and moods. The gloomy, cloudy days were super depressing. I felt more moments of stress during the day I wasn’t focusing on the right things at work. Everything felt random and scattered. I would skip breakfast My energy levels were not as high until after lunch. I felt stagnate. I’m glad I made the change. I hope by sharing what I did you might also be inspired to make a shift as well.
