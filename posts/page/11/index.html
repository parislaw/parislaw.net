Unsurprisingly, most people will give up on their new year’s resolutions by the time Chinese New Year hits ( around early February). I’m also guilty of doing the same. December’s holiday season invokes good feelings that motivate me to make some real, lasting change in my life. But something happened in the last few weeks that gradually dissipated my ambitions. 1. I went back to the office The holiday time gave me a few days off to reflect and think about change. As soon as I came back to the office, I was bombarded with email follow ups and urgent requests. “Reality” snapped back in. 2. I didn’t have a short term picture My new year’s goals were ambitious and very big changes. However, the picture of the journey was not clear enough for me to know where I should go next. I see the final result, but don’t know the components that are required. 3.I didn’t write it down It was fun talking about what could be. Enjoying a drink with friends while sharing what will make 2013 different is fun. Without writing things down there is no way for me to remember exactly what I said. Within 48 hours. It was a skewed recollection. 4. I joked about how I had forgotten It’s good to laugh at yourself at times. We are human after all. There should also be a time to make a serious commitment to something and hold myself accountable. Do you still remember what your new years resolutions are? What’s your secret for reminding yourself

In part 1, we explored the idea of a set point and how it is possible to change certain aspects in our pursuit of happiness. In part 2, we looked at the reality of how our conditions impact our happiness. In this post, we’ll look at voluntarily choices (VC) What is a voluntary choice? I want to be clear about our starting definition of voluntary choices before we continue. A voluntary choice is any instance where we are able to demonstrate our will and preference to take or decided not to take action. 40% of our happiness comes from our voluntary choices. This is second to the set point. Therefore, it each choice should be carefully considered when we want to work toward being happy. The Fundamental Option of our choices In every moment where we make a voluntary choice, we are choosing between two fundamental options: toward our own self-development or the opposite direction. There is no in between. We can move toward making things go right with others and ourselves. We can just as equally influence people into states of conflict or war, as the Arbinger Institute would call it. Indifference is an action. Ignoring is an action. Submission is an action. Deciding not to act When some of my friends and I are deciding on where to eat in Shanghai, I will usually let them choose their preference. I don’t take any action to contribute in the decision-making. I am, however, making a voluntary choice not to assert my preference. This is usually because I indifferent in this particular case. Use I AM There is a model for manifesting the reality that you want. The I AM Model. It states that your
