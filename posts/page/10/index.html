Some dread it. Performance goals I get a lot of questions inside and outside of the office about performance goals, especially this time of year. If you are working in an organization it is very likely that you will have some kind of annual performance review and goal setting ritual in place. Almost every business has a system in place to answer two questions. 1. What is expected to happen this year? 2. How will I know we are making good progress against that expectation? Simple right? If so many groups use this method to set targets for the year, why are the surveys and research always saying how ineffective it is?If the research says it is ineffective, why do we continue to do it? No matter how we feel about goals. We probably still need to go through the process. With that said I’d like to share a few ideas for making your performance goal setting task a little bit easier. disclaimer: these ideas and thoughts are entirely my own and do not reflect any opinions from the organizations that I am associated with. 1. Watch a video on smart goal setting. It’s a good reminder of the key components we need to fill in as we write a goal statement. I don’t want to spend a lot of time going through the definition of each letter (Specific, Measurable, Achieveable/Agreed, Measurable, Timebound). There are plenty of resources online that you can find by typing “SMART Goal” into google. 2. Build on your review from last year. I’ve made the mistake of not using my manager’s comments and suggestions from my past year review. This was a good learning for me. The comments and feedback from a past review can be a good setup for setting performance goals in this year. 3. Don’t try to write them all at once. Some goals require a bit a thinking and creativity to get right. Give yourself a few rounds to imagine the criteria and criterion for which you will measure yourself during the year. 4. Think behaviors. Rather than making a done/not done task, consider writing goals that will require consistency over a long period of time. What are some things you can do on a regular basis that impact a larger outcome during the year? What are the drivers? I see a lot of goals that are only revenue targets. For me, it’s hard to imagine waking up in the morning thinking about how I am going to make more money for someone else. I’d rather be challenged to do some behavior that I know I can control. I can think about how to make it more efficient or improve the quality. 5. Productivity vs Efficiency. These two terms are very similar in concept, but approach their output in different ways. Productivity can be defined by the amount of work within a specific time frame.Example: making more phone calls in one hour. Another example: drinking more cups of tea before you have to go to the bathroom. Efficiency can be defined by speed, accuracy and consistent quality within which an employee works. Example: Can you make a single pot of tea with fewer mistakes than before? Can you save more leaves and get the same great taste out of it? In the working world it might look like writing a report with fewer mistakes and still getting it out on time. It could also be achieving the same sales target and spending less on marketing. 6. Balance long, mid, and short range goals and focus. Ideally you would only want to do one big thing at a time. Most books recommend 3-5 goals at one time. This doesn’t mean you have 3 goals that must be achieved by December 31, 2015. You might have a performance behavior that only needs 90 days to become automated. So you focus for those 90 days and make it amazing. Then it becomes automatic and you move on to the next thing. As a training manager I am often challenged by having a million different request for initiatives coming in. I only have two hands. I can only give attention to setting up one thing at a time. At one point, I desperately tried to make it all work at the same time. I made a portfolio of all the projects being requested with a status indicator and next actions defined. I figured if I could get a little bit done on each one then I would be in a good position of making them all happen at the same time. The reality was that I was making mediocre progress on everything and nothing was getting done. It would have been better to do one thing really well and then find a way to have the process automated. After automated and working like a machine, we move on to the next thing. 7. Create development plans that don’t collect dust. My manager used to list out the training courses I should take to support my development areas. Later I would learn that the budget was cut and I wouldn’t be able to do all the training we listed out. I had to get creative. Development plans are about development, not training. Formal training is probably about 10% of what can support development. Start by identifying your areas of focus. This can be making a strength even stronger or filling a weakness gap. Don’t forget about your strengths! Our strengths are what make us stand out and push us to new levels of achievement. Think about things you are already doing during the day that can be converted into learning challenge. You might be writing proposals for customers. How can your proposal writing be taken to the next level? Is it by writing proposal for bigger revenue customers? Is it by leading a team to write proposals without you touching the actual document? Maybe it is training someone else to make their proposals even better? I don’t know. You’ll have to get creative. Build an opportunity portfolio and find out which ones can be focused on this year.Identify steps you want to take to make these things happen.Agree with your company leader that their is opportunity and support to make things happen. Then go do it. 8. Find an informal location to discuss all this. Working in an corporate cube or fishbowl office is not the most creative space. Get outside. Drink some tea. Go for a walk. Anything informal will do.

What matters most is getting off. You cannot make progress without making decisions.”~Jim Rohn How many habits would you like to change in 2015? How many goals have you set in areas of finances, lifestyle, relationships, physical, mental, spiritual, family and career? how much would be on your list? For many us, we have more than 10 things listed down in the inventory of changes to make. And they all need to be worked on right now! I’ve had several people come to me and say they aren’t sure where to begin. They are paralyzed by all the things that they want to change in their life. They want to travel more, say no more often, find the love of their life, eat less junk food, try to learn to dance, practice more yoga, call family more often, and so on…. BUT the paralysis of wanting to do it all now is overwhelming. Consequently, this doesn’t help anything at all. Below you’ll find 3 strategies for making a decision so you can get going. I like to think of it as a staircase. You could try to jump up the whole staircase at once. And you would probably fall flat on your face. I wouldn’t laugh at you (really!). The safest way to get to the top of the staircase is to take one step at a time. Stepping up one after another will eventually get you to the top. “But that takes too long!” you may be thinking to yourself. If your somewhat athletic you may try jumping two steps at a time to get to the top even faster. The more momentum you build, the more steps you can conquer at one time. Even with momentum and long legs, getting over 5 or 6 steps is really challenging. Going too fast may lead you tumbling down back to the beginning. At the very least you know that you will start with one. It’s a start. Then, How do you decide what the first should be? 1. You could be super analytical like I am and make a decision matrix. Put your options on one axis. List out your deciding criteria on the other and give it a weight. Ease to implement, Affordability, Proximity to home, related to something I’m doing at work. These are some rough examples. After you have your criteria, give each item a score from 1-10 and let the highest scoring item go first. example: Decision_Matrix.xls (excel file) [ download no longer available] contact me for a copy 2. You could ask the focusing question like Gary Keller does. “What is the one thing should do first that by doing it would make everything else easier?" example: “paying down my debt will make it easier to buy those tap dancing shoes I need” another example: “cutting my spending on Cheetos will give me some extra money to pay down my debt. I’ll work on the junk food first." 3. You could leave it to fate. Roll a dice. list out your options, close your eyes and randomly drop your finger on one. Ultimately, deciding one will be enough to get going. Trying to do them all at once leads to exhaustion. Any other ways that you can think of? Share your strategy in the comments. Bonus: I’ll add two more ideas since my brain juice is flowing. I drank some rooibos tea today. 4. Ask 3 friends to vote for their top three choices. Choose the top choice. 5. Go alphabetical. Choose the first one. I think you get my point. Keep moving. Keep Tuning. If you want to receive more cool stuff. Enter your email [newsletter_signup_form id=0]

Gives you some time to pray. Be present, now. Being present, paying attention to the now is our gateway to happiness.

New year’s resolutions are often like that. We make resolutions because we know it would be better for us to lose weight, or get fit, or spend more time with our children. The problem is that a resolution is generally easier to break than it is to keep.” ~ Peter Singer The new year brings new optimism. Although I’m not a fan of new year’s resolutions that you are only going to let fade away before valentine’s day, I do appreciate the honest reflection. I appreciate resolution’s as a method of self awareness, saying what we would like to change. Fun fact: only 15 percent of people actually follow thru with their resolutions. Change happens gradually, in small increments. There is no blue pill, or body tapping pattern magic - you have to do the work. If you are truly committed to gradual change, I can almost guarantee you will change your tune and your habits completely over time. 2015 is going to be an extraordinary year. I can feel it. Below I offer some ideas for making your resolutions truly stickk(I meant to write it that way). 1. Be ready to go all in. Remember the Adidas commitment? Or the newly branded Golin? They are going all in. These brands did more than just say they are going all in. Resolutions typically fail because they are never written down. If you write them down, start taking a few actions during holiday, and then return to work and find that there are 5 other things ready to distract you from your newly created resolve. So what happens? You let them gradually fade away or quit for something “more important.” What if you had to pay half a month’s salary if you smoked one cigarette again? Would you stick to with the plan? Of course you would, be cause there is a very big reason to stay fully committed. Find a smart way to go all in and you’ll find a new level of commitment. How to do it. I recommend getting an accountability partner or coach that can actually witness if you follow through or not. On top of that, I would go on over to Stickk and put your money where your mouth is. Stickk was developed to add some monetary pressure to your quest for change. 2. Focus on changing one small piece at a time. Resolutions are usually BIG and vague. “I want to lose weight.” “I’m going to be nice to the people at work.” “ I’m going to finally travel around the world.” After a while the next big thing will take over and grab your attention. Sometimes these also look like goals that are broken down into deadlines and actions for each week. What happens if you miss a deadline? You beat yourself up for not being committed enough. You feel guilty because that oreo cookie was looking so appealing. How to do it. This is just one idea - focus on creating one habit that will support the resolution. Remember that change is gradual. You can start with one habit and really focus on making that one count. After that habit forms, you then define another one. If you make the habits really small, it is possible to create one new habit each month. Really micro habits might even be created in a weak. Gary Keller wrote, “it takes an average of 66 days to form a new habit”, not 21. It only takes 5 experiences to establish the pattern. However, depending on the complexity, it can take more time to establish as a habit. 3. Work in weekly bursts. Most people try to set a target for the whole year. A whole year is a long time. Enough time to lose motivation. Enough time to forget. Enough time for life to happen. If you focus on making your new change work one week at a time, you can evaluate what worked, what were your barriers, and how you can adapt for the next week. Be agile. How to do it. Don’t spend endless hours putting together a spreadsheet to track your progress throughout the year. All those formulas and trend lines won’t matter when you keep it simple. Go for one week, day by day, completing your new habit. 4. Grab a buddy or a group. I already mentioned this in the first idea, but I’ll reiterate again. Have someone that can keep you accountable for the change. If you can, find a group that is working together to make the change. You can fill each other with inspiration to keep going on. There are tons of resources online for finding people who are trying to make a similar change. Google is a great first start. Meetup.com can help you find groups of similar interests. or do a search on 43things.com for people with the same goals. 5. Visualize your reasons for making the change. Add this to your daily morning ritual. See yourself living and being the new you. What will it feel like? Will there be a chance in your appearance? Will there be a chance in your environment? What will people around you be saying? 6. Be curious and enjoy the journey. Ultimately this is an exercise in becoming more self-aware of who you are becoming. Many may see their resolutions as a black or white thing. They did it or did not. I offer that you see it as an experience, a journey to learn from. This will be a discovery in knowing what works for you, what doesn’t, and what brick walls will get in your way. If something comes along and shift you away from this resolution, it must have been an amazing thing. That’s a story worth capturing and sharing later. This is not about good or bad, success or failure - it’s all about self tuning. Enjoy it. 7. Drink some tea. I guess I am a little biased because I like tea. Even more than drinking tea, I like that it is a healthy way to force yourself to sit down and reflect on the week or get ready for the day ahead. 2015 is going to be extraordinary.

If you are feeling out of tune, Pray. This will give you the space to reset. If you feel there are too many things to do and not enough time, pray.

If you feel things are moving too fast, pray. This will slow you down. If you feel excited and an achievement, pray. We are able to do these things through God’s wisdom and guidance. In all things, give thanks. In all circumstances, pray. Prayer has power. Prayer is an opportunity for us to reconnect with God and get back in resonance with our true purpose.
